---++ Parameters
     %STARTSECTION{"history_attributes"}%
     | *Parameter*         | *Description*  | *Default*  |
     | ="format"= <br /> =format="format"= | Format of one line, may include any variable which is supported by macro [[%SYSTEMWEB%.VarREVINFO][REVINFO]] | <code>r$rev - $date - $wikiusername</code> |
     | =topic= | Topic name, can be in =web.topic= format | current topic |
     | =web= | Web name | current web |
     | =versions= | Number or range (format: =from..to=). Examples: %BR% \
     To get version 2, write: =versions="2"= %BR% \
     To get version 2 to 3, write: =versions="2..3"= %BR% \
     To get version 2 to the latest, write: =versions="2.."= %BR% \
     To get all versions up to version 5, write: =versions="..5"= %BR% \
     To get all versions up to but not including the latest, write: =versions="..-1"= %BR% \
     To get the versions from 1 to 5 in reverse order, write: =versions="5..1"= \
     | all versions in the order latest to first |
     | =header= | Text to print before the list. %BR% \
     May contain the tokens =$next= and =$previous= which will be evaluated if there are newer or older revisions available for the topic that are not listed according to =versions= (or =rev1=, =rev2=, =nrev=). %BR% \
     These tokens take the syntax =$next{'some text' url='url'}= (the same for =$previous=). 'some text' is the text which should be printed, 'url' is the url for the corresponding link. %BR% \
     The tokens =$rev1=, =$rev2=, =$nrev= in 'text' or 'url' will be replaced by appropriate values for the next or previous block of revisions. See the attached =oopshistory.tmpl= for an example of how to use this. | =$next= |
     | =footer="text"= | Text to print after the list. May contain the tokens =$next= and =$previous= (see =header=) | =$previous= |

Deprecated (but supported) parameters:
     | *Parameter*         | *Description*  | *Default*  |
     | =nrev= | Number of revisions to show. Ignored if =versions= is specified, or if both =rev1= and =rev2= are specified. | =10= |
     | =rev2= | Newest revision to show | =rev1+nrev= if =rev1= is specified, latest revision otherwise |
     | =rev1= | Oldest revision to show | =rev2-nrev= |
     | =reverse= |Show newest revisions first, if =on= | ="on"= |

---+++ Additional macros
The following macros are expanded only if there is a corresponding =%<nop>HISTORY%= on the page. If more than one =%<nop>HISTORY%= is used on the same page, the values from the last one will be used.

   * =%<nop>HISTORY_REV1%=: Oldest revision from the printed history
   * =%<nop>HISTORY_REV2%=: Latest revision from the printed history
   * =%<nop>HISTORY_NREV%=: Number of the printed revisions
   * =%<nop>HISTORY_MAXREV%=: Latest available revision of the topic
