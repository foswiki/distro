---+ package EmptyPlugin

Foswiki plugins 'listen' to events happening in the core by registering an
interest in those events. They do this by declaring 'plugin handlers'. These
are simply functions with a particular name that, if they exist in your
plugin, will be called by the core.

This is an empty Foswiki plugin. It is a fully defined plugin, but is
disabled by default in a Foswiki installation. Use it as a template
for your own plugins.

To interact with Foswiki use ONLY the official APIs
documented in %SYSTEMWEB%.DevelopingPlugins. <strong>Do not reference any
packages, functions or variables elsewhere in Foswiki</strong>, as these are
subject to change without prior warning, and your plugin may suddenly stop
working.

Error messages can be output using the =Foswiki::Func= =writeWarning= and
=writeDebug= functions. You can also =print STDERR=; the output will appear
in the webserver error log. Most handlers can also throw exceptions (e.g.
[[%SCRIPTURL{view}%/%SYSTEMWEB%/PerlDoc?module=Foswiki::OopsException][Foswiki::OopsException]])

For increased performance, all handler functions except =initPlugin= are
commented out below. *To enable a handler* remove the leading =#= from
each line of the function. For efficiency and clarity, you should
only uncomment handlers you actually use.

__NOTE:__ When developing a plugin it is important to remember that

Foswiki is tolerant of plugins that do not compile. In this case,
the failure will be silent but the plugin will not be available.
See %SYSTEMWEB%.InstalledPlugins for error messages.

__NOTE:__ Foswiki:Development.StepByStepRenderingOrder helps you decide which
rendering handler to use. When writing handlers, keep in mind that these may
be invoked

on included topics. For example, if a plugin generates links to the current
topic, these need to be generated before the =afterCommonTagsHandler= is run.
After that point in the rendering loop we have lost the information that
the text had been included from another topic.

Called to initialise the plugin. If everything is OK, should return
a non-zero value. On non-fatal failure, should write a message
using =Foswiki::Func::writeWarning= and return 0. In this case

In the case of a catastrophic failure that will prevent the whole

will be trapped and reported in the browser.

your Plugin is called !FooBarPlugin, name macros FOOBAR and/or
FOOBARSOMETHING. This avoids namespace issues.

Allows a plugin to set the username. Normally Foswiki gets the username
from the login manager. This handler gives you a chance to override the
login manager.

   * =$included= - Boolean flag indicating whether the handler is
     invoked on an included topic
   * =$meta= - meta-data object for the topic MAY BE =undef=
This handler is called by the code that expands %<nop>MACROS% syntax in
the topic body and in form fields. It may be called many times while
a topic is being rendered.

Only plugins that have to parse the entire topic content should implement
this function. For expanding macros with trivial syntax it is *far* more
efficient to use =Foswiki::Func::registerTagHandler= (see =initPlugin=).

Internal Foswiki macros, (and any macros declared using
=Foswiki::Func::registerTagHandler=) are expanded _before_, and then again
_after_, this function is called to ensure all %<nop>MACROS% are expanded.

*NOTE:* when this handler is called, &lt;verbatim> blocks have been
removed from the text (though all other blocks such as &lt;pre> and
&lt;noautolink> are still present).

*NOTE:* meta-data is _not_ embedded in the text passed to this
handler. Use the =$meta= object.

This handler is called after Foswiki has completed expansion of %MACROS%.
It is designed for use by cache plugins. Note that when this handler
is called, &lt;verbatim> blocks are present in the text.

*NOTE*: This handler is called once for each call to

---++ preRenderingHandler( $text, \%map )
   * =$text= - text, with the head, verbatim and pre blocks replaced
     with placeholders
   * =\%removed= - reference to a hash that maps the placeholders to
     the removed blocks.

Handler called immediately before Foswiki syntax structures (such as lists) are
processed, but after all variables have been expanded. Use this handler to
process special syntax only recognised by your plugin.

Placeholders are text strings constructed using the tag name and a
sequence number e.g. 'pre1', "verbatim6", "head1" etc. Placeholders are
inserted into the text inside &lt;!--!marker!--&gt; characters so the
text will contain &lt;!--!pre1!--&gt; for placeholder pre1.

Each removed block is represented by the block text and the parameters
passed to the tag (usually empty) e.g. for
<verbatim>
<pre class='slobadob'>
XYZ
</pre>
</verbatim>
the map will contain:
<pre>
$removed->{'pre1'}{text}:   XYZ
$removed->{'pre1'}{params}: class="slobadob"
</pre>
Iterating over blocks for a single tag is easy. For example, to prepend a
line number to every line of every pre block you might use this code:
<verbatim>
foreach my $placeholder ( keys %$map ) {
    if( $placeholder =~ /^pre/i ) {
        my $n = 1;
        $map->{$placeholder}{text} =~ s/^/$n++/gem;
    }
}
</verbatim>

__NOTE__: This handler is called once for each rendered block of text i.e.
it may be called several times during the rendering of a topic.

---++ mergeHandler( $diff, $old, $new, \%info ) -> $text
Try to resolve a difference encountered during merge. The =differences= 
array is an array of hash references, where each hash contains the 
following fields:
   * =$diff= => one of the characters '+', '-', 'c' or ' '.
      * '+' - =new= contains text inserted in the new version
      * '-' - =old= contains text deleted from the old version

        from the version being saved
      * ' ' - =new= contains text common to both versions, or the change
        only involved whitespace
   * =$old= => text from version currently saved
   * =$new= => text from version being saved
   * =\%info= is a reference to the form field description { name, title,
     type, size, value, tooltip, attributes, referenced }. It must _not_
     be wrtten to. This parameter will be undef when merging the body
     text of the topic.

Plugins should try to resolve differences and return the merged text. 
For example, a radio button field where we have 
={ diff=>'c', old=>'Leafy', new=>'Barky' }= might be resolved as 
='Treelike'=. If the plugin cannot resolve a difference it should return 
undef.

The merge handler will be called several times during a save; once for 
each difference that needs resolution.

If any merges are left unresolved after all plugins have been given a 
chance to intercede, the following algorithm is used to decide how to 
merge the data:
   1 =new= is taken for all =radio=, =checkbox= and =select= fields to 
     resolve 'c' conflicts
   1 '+' and '-' text is always included in the the body text and text
     fields
   1 =&lt;del>conflict&lt;/del> &lt;ins>markers&lt;/ins>= are used to 
     mark 'c' merges in text fields

The merge handler is called whenever a topic is saved, and a merge is 
required to resolve concurrent edits on a topic.

   * =$hasExplicitLinkLabel= - true if the link is of the form =[<nop>[Link][blah blah]]= (false if it's ==<nop>[Blah]] or =BlahBlah=)
   * =$web=, =$topic= - specify the topic being rendered

Called during rendering, this handler allows the plugin a chance to change
the rendering of labels used for links.

Return the new link text.

*Since:* Foswiki::Plugins::VERSION 2.0

---++ completePageHandler($html, $httpHeaders)

This handler is called on the ingredients of every page that is
output by the standard CGI scripts. It is designed primarily for use by
cache and security plugins.
   * =$html= - the body of the page (normally &lt;html>..$lt;/html>)
   * =$httpHeaders= - the HTTP headers. Note that the headers do not contain
     a =Content-length=. That will be computed and added immediately before
     the page is actually written. This is a string, which must end in \n\n.

*Since:* Foswiki::Plugins::VERSION 2.0

=cut

#sub completePageHandler {
#    my( $html, $httpHeaders ) = @_;
#    # modify $_[0] or $_[1] if you must change the HTML or headers
#    # You can work on $html and $httpHeaders in place by using the
#    # special perl variables $_[0] and $_[1]. These allow you to operate
#    # on parameters as if they were passed by reference; for example:
#    # $_[0] =~ s/SpecialString/my alternative/ge;
#}

=begin TML

---++ restExample($session) -> $text

This is an example of a sub to be called by the =rest= script. The parameter is:
   * =$session= - The Foswiki object associated to this session.

Additional parameters can be recovered via the query object in the $session.

For more information, check %SYSTEMWEB%.CommandAndCGIScripts#rest

For information about handling error returns from REST handlers, see
Foswiki::Support.Faq1

*Since:* Foswiki::Plugins::VERSION 2.0

=cut

#sub restExample {
#   my ($session) = @_;
#   return "This is an example of a REST invocation\n\n";
