---++ Logo Customization

The logo can be changed by redefining the =WIKILOGOIMG= [[%SYSTEMWEB%.PreferenceSettings][preference setting]].

If you use the official TWiki.org artwork on your own site you can link back to TWiki.org. Use this HTML (with any logo file on this page):

=&lt;a href="http://twiki.org/"&gt;&lt;img src="%<nop>PUBURL%/%<nop>SYSTEMWEB%/ProjectLogos/T-logo-140x40-t.gif" alt="This site is powered by the TWiki collaboration platform" title="This site is powered by the TWiki collaboration platform" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;=

If you create your own TWiki skin you are encouraged to add the small 80x31 pixel TWiki logo at the bottom of your skin:

=&lt;a href="http://twiki.org/"&gt;&lt;img src="%<nop>PUBURL%/%<nop>SYSTEMWEB%/ProjectLogos/T-logo-80x15.gif" alt="This site is powered by the TWiki collaboration platform" width="80" height="15" title="This site is powered by the TWiki collaboration platform" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;=
