# Sample '.htaccess' file for subdirectories

# Controls access to TWiki subdirectories other than 'bin' and 'pub'
# - copy this into 'data', 'lib', 'locale', 'working' and 'templates'
# naming it '.htaccess', to have Apache use it.

# This is useful if you install TWiki on a web host, or an intranet host
# where you can't edit the Apache http.conf file.  If you can edit the
# http.conf file, just set the 'deny from all' there (or locate these
# directories outside the Web-visible directory tree.)

# Deny all access
Deny from all
