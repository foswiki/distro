---+!! Slide Show Plugin

%SHORTDESCRIPTION%

%TOC%

---++ Introduction

There is already a _de facto_ standard for presentations, so why this plugin?
This plugin makes sense for organizations that already have lots of content in Foswiki:
It is easy to create a web based presentation that contains many links to related content.
The plugin does not try to compete with the bells and whistles of other presentation programs.
However, the markup of Foswiki and other plugins such as Foswiki:Extensions/ChartPlugin, Foswiki:Extensions/GaugePlugin, Foswiki:Extensions/SpreadSheetPlugin, Foswiki:Extensions/JHotDrawPlugin can be used to create appealing presentations.

Any topic with headings can be converted into a slideshow.
Each slide starts with a ="---++"= heading.
There are two modes to view a topic:

   * Normal topic view mode:
     Headings and text are shown in the usual Foswiki rendering,
     representing the outline of the slideshow.
     This mode is useful for printing handouts.

   * Presentation mode:
     Each heading with text is shown as a slide;
     the format is based on a slide template.
     Navigation buttons are added to go to the "First", "Previous", and "Next" slide.
     Slide navigation is quick because it is done with anchor jumps to the same page. 

You can start the presentation by clicking on the "Start presentation" button.

---++ Syntax rules

---+++ How to create a slideshow

   * Start with =%<nop>SLIDESHOWSTART%=
      * Use the optional =template= parameter to specify your own slide template topic,
        e.g. =%<nop>SLIDESHOWSTART{ template="MyOwnSlideTemplate" }%=
   * Create the slides.
     Start each slide with a ="---++"= heading and add text
     such as paragraphs, bullets, tables and images.
      * *Hint:* Make sure to keep each slide short enough
        that you do not need to scroll to see all text of a slide during the presentation.
      * *Note:* You can use any heading levels you like,
        but use the same levels for all slides.
   * End your slideshow with =%<nop>SLIDESHOWEND%=

---+++ How to create your own slide template

To create your own template topic, 
copy the "Default Slide Template" section below (or from [[SlideShowPluginTableTemplate]]) into your own slide template topic
and customize it to your needs.
It can be activated as the default template in the plugin's =TEMPLATE= setting,
or per slideshow with the =%<nop>SLIDESHOWSTART{ template="MyOwnSlideTemplate" }%= setting.

   * Use a DIV or an HTML table that defines a slide. 
     For example, create one row for the slide title, another one for the slide text.
   * These keywords can be used:
     | *Keyword* | *What it means* |
     | =%<nop>SLIDETITLE%= | The heading of the slide |
     | =%<nop>SLIDETEXT%= | The text of the slide |
     | =%<nop>SLIDECOMMENT%= | The comment of the slide (optional; appended to slide of missing) |
     | =%<nop>SLIDENUM%= | The current slide number |
     | =%<nop>SLIDEMAX%= | The last slide number |
  * And for navigation buttons:
     | =%<nop>SLIDENAV%= | The navigation buttons for "First", "Previous", "Next" slide |
     | =%<nop>SLIDENAVALL%= | The navigation buttons for "First", "Previous", "Next", "Last" slide |
     | =%<nop>SLIDENAVFIRST%= | The navigation button for "First slide" |
     | =%<nop>SLIDENAVPREV%= | The navigation button for "Previous slide" |
     | =%<nop>SLIDENAVNEXT%= | The navigation button for "Next slide" |
     | =%<nop>SLIDENAVLAST%= | The navigation button for "Last slide" |
   * Only text between =%<nop>STARTINCLUDE%= and =%<nop>STOPINCLUDE%= is used for the template.

---++ Example

This is a short example of a slideshow.
You should see a "Start presentation" button if this plugin is installed:

%SLIDESHOWSTART%
<!--
---++ Introduction
This is slide one. 

%TOC%

---++ Hamlet meets his father's ghost

   * Hamlet learns that his father was killed by his brother Claudius and Queen Gertrude.
   * Claudius has quickly become king.

---++ This is rather upsetting

   * The ghost demands revenge.
   * Hamlet agrees.
   * His friends swear to keep what they have seen a secret.

---++ Meanwhile...

   * the King's advisor Polonius meets his daughter Ophelia. Hamlet has upset her.
   * Hamlet is acting mad
   
---+++ Comments

   * This text is not shown in the slide if HIDECOMMENTS is set to on.
   * It can have
   * many
   * more
   * bullets

---++ Please tune this template

%IF{"$'URLPARAM{slideshow}'='on'" then="http://www.ibiblio.org/wm/paint/auth/durer/large-turf.jpg"}%

---+++ Comments

One-liner: this text is not shown in the slide if HIDECOMMENTS is set to "on".
%SLIDESHOWEND%

This text is not part of the slideshow.

---++ <nop>%TOPIC% preferences

You can override the default settings for the plugin by defining the following [[%SYSTEMWEB%.PreferenceSettings][preferences]].
<!--
   * Set SHORTDESCRIPTION = %$SHORTDESCRIPTION%
%JQREQUIRE{"chili"}%
-->

| *Preference* | *Meaning* | *Default* |
| SLIDESHOWPLUGIN_TEMPLATE | Default template for slides: | SlideShowPlugin |
| SLIDESHOWPLUGIN_COMMENTS_LABEL | Label for Comments section | Comments |
| SLIDESHOWPLUGIN_HIDECOMMENTS | Hide text starting with a =---+++ %COMMENTS_LABEL%= heading | |

---++ Default slide template

You can create a new topic (!MyWeb.SlidesTemplate) somewhere
and add =STARTINCLUDE &lt;your template&gt; STOPINCLUDE= to it.
Afterwards, you can add =%SLIDESHOWSTART{template="MyWeb.SlidesTemplate"}%=
to show your presentations with this new template.
%BR%

|  Change History: | <!-- versions below in reverse order -->&nbsp; |
|  FIXME | Never released 3.0: Arthur Clemens: Based on <nop>JQueryPlugin's [[%SYSTEMWEB%.JQueryCycle][Cycle Plugin]]. \
           Changed implementation to use a template to make it possible to have skin overrides. \
           The templates uses full window width and height. 
           If no control buttons are used in the template (the new default template for instance, \
           a new control bar at the top is displayed including a jump field to go directly to a slide number; \
           proceed by clicking on the slide or by using the left and right arrow keys. \
           Created legacy/fallback template SlideShowPluginTableTemplate that uses a table layout. |
