---++ Foswiki - The Free and Open Source Wiki

Foswiki is an enterprise collaboration and information sharing tool targeted for professional use in many types of organizations: from small businesses to multi-nationals, from one-product open source groups, to worldwide research networks.

Foswiki is a wiki: fundamentally, a website with editable web pages. It looks like a normal web site but it encourages contributions, edits, updates, questions, and answers from its users. It's a powerful way of enabling a community to communicate asynchronously using intranet and public internet websites. Foswiki is simple to learn and use. It aims to provide a transparent way for you to publish and exchange your ideas with others over the web and eliminates the one-webmaster syndrome of outdated intranet content.

Foswiki is a structured wiki with tools that enable users without programming  skills to build powerful yet simple applications to process information and  support workflows. Developers can extend the functionality of Foswiki with plugins.

Foswiki is the old TWiki project under a new name. Restrictions on the use  of the TWiki brand resulted in many of its developers continuing the project  under the new Foswiki name. Foswiki is backwards compatible with all content  from older TWiki installations. Foswiki 1.1 ships with a !TWikiCompatibilityPlugin  installed and activated by default, thus enabling most extensions  made for TWiki to work under Foswiki.

Since the start of the Foswiki project there have been several releases of TWiki,  However there have been very few functionality changes, and the useful changes  have all been tracked in Foswiki, so topics and wiki applications  supported by TWiki should also work with Foswiki.

Foswiki is released under the GNU General Public License.

***UPDATE ME***

See ReleaseNotes01x00 for detailed information about changes in that release.

---++ Important Changes since Foswiki 1.0.9

Foswiki 1.1 comes with a lot of "under the hood" improvements to the core code,  with the goal of making it easier to plug in work from other projects, such  as jQuery, !KinoSearch, Solr and others. We have also worked to improve  the definition of internal APIs to allow other not-yet-written modules,  such as store implementations, to plug in. Most of these modifications  should be invisible to the end user and the admin, but are important to  position Foswiki for the next generation of improvements.

---+++ Powerful new =QUERY= macro
A number of new features have been added with the goal of improving support  for wiki applications. These include the powerful new =QUERY= macro,  which supports formatted access to formfields and other meta-data in  topics using the same syntax as is used in =IF= and =SEARCH= statements.

Use of the ="formfield"= parameter to the =META= macro has been deprecated
(it is still available, but use is discouraged and it will be removed at some
point in the future).

---+++ Re-architecting of the SEARCH macro
To improve the speed, consistency and extendability of the most complex  and important Macro, we've started to separate the generation of search results from the outputing of FormattedSearch. The most significant user facing  improvements are speed and reliability changes - with many more unit tests written to ensure future compatibility.

---+++ FOREACH macro
The extraction of the FormattedSearch system has made it possible to provide a  Macro that allows users to render a comma separated list into any =header=,  =footer=, =format= style.

---+++ %USERSWEB%.WikiGroups have add & remove user interface
!WikiGroups are now be edited using a much simpler HTML form.

For developers additional API's have been added to the Foswiki code to allow these Forms to also be used for non-Foswiki user and group backends.

With some configuration, Foswiki can also add users to groups on registration -  either automatically, or allowing the users to select groups to join.

---+++ TinyMCEPlugin updates
TinyMCEPlugin has been updated to the latest 3.3.x release from Moxiecode. Additionally, some improvements to the Foswiki integration have been made, such as:
   * Smarter attach dialogue
   * Background autosave feature has been enabled (saves to local browser storage at 3 minute intervals)
   * New context (right-click) menu:
      * Set syntax highlighting classes on verbatim blocks
      * table rows/columns may be duplicated, cells merged/split
   * Customisation via the =TINYMCEPLUGIN_INIT= variable has been improved. [[TinyMCEPlugin#UpgradeFrom01x00][Read the upgrade advice]] if you are upgrading a Foswiki installation which uses a custom =TINYMCEPLUGIN_INIT= preference setting.

---+++ Testing configuration variables in %IF
Prior to 1.1, %IF could be used to test the value of any configuration variable (those defined in =configure=). This represented a security risk, so now only those variables listed in ={AccessibleCFG}= may be accessed this way. Note that ={AccessibleCFG}= also controls which variables are visible in =%SEARCH{type="query"= and the new =%QUERY= macro.

---+++ "Copy topic" now copies attachments
The "Copy Topic" function in "More topic actions" now copies attachments as well as the topic text and form.

---+++ Tailoring of user registration made easier.

The topic System.UserRegistration has been enhanced so it now determines  whether a custom user registration page exists in %USERSWEB%, and  includes it if it does; otherwise it includes DefaultUserRegistration.

This means that your tailored version in %USERSWEB% web will not be  overwritten by future upgrades.

You can create a custom version of the UserRegistration form by first  copying the topic DefaultUserRegistration to !UserRegistration in  %USERSWEB% web. This will ensure that your changes will remain intact next time you upgrade.

A couple of common fields are hidden from normal view to make the  registration page as simple as possible. You can unhide those fields  on the page by removing =EXCLUDED_= from the =INCLUDE= tags).

---+++ Easy tailoring of reset/change password and change email forms

The topics %SYSTEMWEB%.ResetPassword and %SYSTEMWEB%.ChangePassword now  only show the change forms when Foswiki is managing the passwords  (the =configure= setting ={PasswordManager}= set to a manager that handles setting of passwords).

If the {PasswordManager} does not support password changing,  the ChangePassword and ResetPassword topics will show a simple message.  This message is defined iby the preference =CHANGEPASSWORDDISABLEDMESSAGE=  in %SYSTEMWEB%.DefaultPreferences. You can redefine this setting by copying  it to %USERSWEB%.SitePreferences and change it to include a link to the  password management website of your organisation.

ChangeEmailAddress will now guide the user to define the email address  in the user topic when the !PasswordManager does not handle hidden email addresses,  so you should not need to tailor this topic any longer.

---+++ Logging of access failures
Configure and !TemplateLogin now log authentication failures to the event logs:

   * =working/logs/configure.log=
   * =working/logs/events.log=
   
It is possible to monitor these logs with a product like =fail2ban= which will set firewall filters due to excessive failures.

---+++ =configure= user interface revamp
Also included in 1.1 is a major improvement to the =configure= user interface, that clarifies and simplifies setting configuration options.

---+++ Configure file system checks
The configuration tool =bin/configure= now performs extensive checks of file system permissions.  The pub and data directories are checked to verify that all data files match the requested default permissions of =755= for directories and =644= for data files.  Files with excess permissions are reported as a warning.  Files with insufficient permissions are noted as an error.

Because of prior inconsistencies in the files distributed with Foswiki and TWiki core and extensions, migration of older Foswiki or TWiki installs may see excessive errors reported by configure.  You are recommended to correct the file system permissions. 

---+++ Newer modern Icon set for DocumentGraphics.
To celebrate our new look, project and momentum, Foswiki now has a new ICON set  to update the one shipped for the last 10 years. Using the !FamFamFam icon set,  augmented with icons from other leading graphic artists.

---+++ Table Plugin has been improved.
HTML formatting has been replaced by pure CSS rendering. You can however enable inline markup HTML, in addition to the CSS markup, by setting the new parameter =inlinemarkup= to "on". This is useful if your users often copy/paste content of topics containing tables into HTML formatted emails or Office documents.

Sorting has been improved so the plugin can now better handle mix of formats and even empty cells.

---+++ Notes for extension authors

---++++ API Enhancements
The following functions have been added to the =Foswiki::Func= API:

   * =copyAttachment=

---++++ Deprecated handlers
The following handlers have been deprecated (i.e. they are still available, but should not be used in new code and will be removed in a future release, so if you have been used them, you need to modify your code).

The =redirectCGIQueryHandler= plugin handler has been deprecated (it is still available, but should not be used in new code and will be removed in a future release, so if you have been used it, you need to modify your code). This handler assumed a level of interaction with the CGI handling process that is dangerous if misused, and severely limits the flexibility and optimisations available to the core.

The =beforeAttachmentSaveHandler= and =afterAttachmentSaveHandler= plugin handlers have been deprecated in favour of the newly added =beforeUploadHandler= and =afterUploadHandler. The new handlers operate on streams, and are more efficient as well as more secure.

Deprecated handlers will continue to work as documented in 1.1 and for the immediate future, but will be removed in a future release. Extension authors are strongly recommended to implement the new handlers as soon as possible.

---++++ Deprecated Foswiki::Func functions
The =readTopicText= and =saveTopicText= functions have been deprecated. Use =readTopic= and =saveTopic= instead. Both =readTopic= and =saveTopic= have always been available in Foswiki (and it's predecessor) and are a lot safer. Existing code can usually be modified to eliminate these deprecated functions without difficulty.

__Note:__ =readTopicText= had implicit access control checks. The replacement method, =readTopic= does not, so calling code must call =checkAccessPermission= explicitly.

---++++ Refactored =Foswiki::Store= and new =Foswiki::Meta= functions
Access checking has been moved from Store up to the Meta and Func routines. This was done to significantly improve perfomance of the Store backend.

Store was never part of the Foswiki or TWiki API.  Extensions which violate this API and reference =Store::= functions directly could potentially have access that was previously blocked by Foswiki and/or may require other changes to be compatible with Foswiki 1.1.

Extension authors should first try to use the =Foswiki::Func= API.  This is the preferred API. Pay careful attention to whether or not each =Func::= method verifies access control and use the =Foswiki::Func::checkAccessPermission= to verify access.

=Foswiki::Meta= should be used only if =Foswiki::Func= does not have a needed function. Note that =Foswiki::Meta= functions do not implicitly perform any access control checks.  Callers of =Foswiki::Meta== should first use the =Foswiki::Meta::haveAccess=  function to verify access for the planned actions.  This was done by design to reduce repetitive access control checks and improve performance.

---++++ Tainting
The Foswiki core now checks values used for web, topic and attachment names for 'taintedness' when FOSWIKI_ASSERTS are enabled. Tainted values are those that have been taken from user input (for example, from topic content or from form fields) without being validated. Such unchecked values are a large potential security hole, and the authors of plugins that manipulate topics or attachments need to check their plugins with Foswiki ASSERTs enabled. If you find a taint error, you can use the functions in =Foswiki::Sandbox= to validate them. For example, to validate a web name and a topic name, you would write:

<verbatim>
$validWebName = Foswiki::Sandbox::untaint(
    $webName, \&Foswiki::Sandbox::validateWebName);
$validTopicName = Foswiki::Sandbox::untaint(
    $topicName, \&Foswiki::Sandbox::validateWebName);
</verbatim>

If =$webName= is not a legal web name, then =$webName= will end up being undefined. Similarly for the topic name.

Note that values are only checked for taintedness when FOSWIKI_ASSERTS are enabled, so unless you run your Foswiki in this mode, you will never see the errors. To enable asserts, simply add the line:

<verbatim>
$ENV{FOSWIKI_ASSERTS} = 1;
</verbatim>

to your =bin/LocalLib.cfg=.
