---+ History Plugin

%$SHORTDESCRIPTION%.

The output can arbitrarily be formatted. An example for a Wikipedia-like history is included.

When using PatternSkin enabling the !HistoryPlugin changes the "History" link in the bottom action bar so it opens a page with a nice user interface where you can select the versions to compare.

With other skins for Foswiki you will need to tweak the templates.

If [[Foswiki:Extensions.CompareRevisionsAddOn][CompareRevisionsAddOn]] is installed and activated the "History" user interface will allow you to choose how the changes are rendered (interweaved vs side-by-side, and context).

If [[Foswiki:Extensions.RevCommentPlugin][RevCommentPlugin]] is installed and activated the "History" page will show the comments entered for each revision.

This plugins is designed to work together with !CompareRevisionsAddOn and !RevCommentPlugin but works well on its own or with just one of the two other plugins.

---++ Syntax Rules
Syntax: =%<nop>HISTORY{ _attributes_ }%=

%INCLUDE{"%SYSTEMWEB%.VarHISTORY" section="history_attributes"}%
   
---++ Examples

The call %<nop>HISTORY% shows a simple list of available revisions like%BR%
<pre>
r3 - 17 Feb 2005 - 09:56 - AnUser
r2 - 31 Dec 2004 - 10:22 - AnotherUser
r1 - 15 Nov 2003 - 01:23 - YetAnotherUser
</pre>

For a more complex example see the attached =oopshistory.tmpl= which also allows the comparison of two selected revisions. 

Example screenshot of the topic history with !HistoryPlugin enabled and working with !CompareRevisionsAddOn and !RevCommentPlugin.
