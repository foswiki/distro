---+ Go Box
The box at the top or sidebar of each page, also called Jump box. 

Enter a topic name to quickly jump to the topic, for example:
   * *WebNotify* to jump to <nop>WebNotify in the current web
   * *%USERSWEB%.WebNotify* to jump to <nop>WebNotify in the %USERSWEB% web
   * *%USERSWEB%.* to jump to the home of the %USERSWEB% web
   * *BrandNewTopic* to jump to a non existing topic in the current web, which is useful to create orphaned topics

Enter part of a topic name to get a list of similar topics, for example:
   * *faq* to get %SEARCH{ "faq" scope="topic" nosearch="on" nototal="on" format="[[$topic]]" separator=", " }%
   * *%USERSWEB%.users*  to jump to the %USERSWEB% web from any web, and get a list of topics about users (all in one step)

*%T% Tip:* Entering part of a topic name is a simple, yet powerful way to quickly navigate to content of interest, also in a large wiki.

*Note:* The Go box is not a search box
