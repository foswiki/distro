---+ Site Tools

Utilities for searching, navigation, and monitoring site activity

Site Tools include utilities for navigating, searching and keeping up with site activity.

In particular, you have two highly configurable, automated site monitoring tools, *<nop>WebNotify*, to e-mail alerts when topics are edited, and *<nop>%STATISTICSTOPIC%*, to generate detailed activity reports.

%TOC%

#WebNotify
---++ <nop>WebNotify - recent changes alert

%INCLUDE{"WebNotifyHelp" section="includeasdocumentation"}%

#WebSearch
---++ <nop>WebSearch - search the site

WebSearch is a flexible search facility, part of the core feature set. WebSearchAdvanced offers more options, including:
   * topic title or full-text search
   * regular expressions
   * query search over form data
   * search within web or site-wide
   * index-style A-Z alphabetical listing sorted topic title
   * many more

See also: SearchHelp for help; [[%SYSTEMWEB%.Macros][Macros]] and FormattedSearch for including hard-coded searches in text.

#WebChanges
---++ <nop>WebChanges - what's new

To check for the most recently edited topics while on-site, use the WebChanges link, usually located in the toolbar. It lists the most recently modified topics, newest first, along with the first couple of lines of the page content.

This is simply a preset =SEARCH=. The number of topics listed by the =limit= parameter.:
<verbatim class="tml">
%SEARCH{ "1" web="%BASEWEB%" type="query" nosearch="on"
  order="modified" reverse="on" limit="50"
}%</verbatim>

#WebRssAndAtom
---++ <nop>WebRss and <nop>WebAtom - news feeds on recent changes

You can point your news reader at WebRss and WebAtom to find out what is new in a web. WebRssBase and WebAtomBase have the details. Like WebChanges, this is based on a =%<nop>SEARCH{}%=.

#WebIndex
---++ <nop>WebIndex - list of topics

WebIndex lists all web topics in alphabetical order, with the first couple of lines of text. This is simply a preset =SEARCH=:
<verbatim class="tml">
%SEARCH{"1" scope="topic" type="query" nosearch="on" }%</verbatim>

#WebStatistics
---++ <nop>%STATISTICSTOPIC% - site statistics
See SiteToolStatistics for detailed configuration and customization information.

%INCLUDE{"SiteToolStatistics" section="SiteTools"}%

#LogFiles
---++ Log Files

Foswiki generates an event log which is used by the statistics script
   * The directory for the log file is defined by the =={Log}{Dir}== setting in [[%SCRIPTURLPATH{"configure"}%][configure]] =Logging and Statistics= tab.
   * The file name is =events.log= Old events are archived as =events.&lt;year&gt;&lt;month&gt;=
   * Example path name: =working/logs/events.log=
   * Each access gets logged as: %BR%
     =| &lt;time&gt; | &lt;wikiusername&gt; | &lt;action&gt; | &lt;web&gt;.&lt;topic&gt; | &lt;extra info&gt; | &lt;IP address&gt; |=
   * Example log entry: %BR%
     =| %SERVERTIME{$day $mon $year - $hour:$min}% | %USERSWEB%.WikiGuest | view | %SYSTEMWEB%.WebRss | | 66.124.232.02 |=
   * By default the following actions are logged:
     | *Script* | *Action name* | *Extra info* |
     | attach | =attach= | when viewing attach screen of previous uploaded attachment: =filename= |
     | changes | =changes= | |
     | edit | =edit= | when editing non-existing topic: =(not exist)= |
     | login | =login= | Authentication failure or success |
     | manage | =rename= | when moving topic: =moved to !Newweb.NewTopic= |
     | manage | =move= | when moving attachment: =Attachment filename moved to !Newweb.NewTopic= |
     | manage | =renameweb= | when renaming a web: =oldweb moved to newweb= |
     | rdiff | =rdiff= | higher and lower revision numbers: =4 3= |
     | register | =regstart= | !WikiUserName, e-Mail address, UserName: =user attempts to register= |
     | register | =register= | E-mail address: =user successfully registers= |
     | register | =bulkregister= | !WikiUserName of new, e-mail address, admin ID |
     | save | =save= | when replacing existing revision: =repRev 3= %BR% when user checks the minor changes box: =dontNotify= %BR% when user changes attributes to an exising attachment: =filename.ext= |
     | save | =cmd= | special admin parameter used when saving |
     | search | =search= | search string |
     | upload | =upload= | filename |
     | view | =view= | when viewing non-existing topic: =(not exist)= %BR% when viewing previous topic revision: =r3= |
     | n/a | =logout= | When authentication information is cleared |
   * You can disable the logging (and therefore the reporting) of individual actions using the =={Log}{Action}== %RED%EXPERT%ENDCOLOR% setting in =configure=.

#ConfigureEmail
---++ E-mail

See also [[%SYSTEMWEB%.InstallationGuidePart2#EmailConfig]]

---+++ Configuring outgoing mail

Outgoing mail is required for UserRegistration and for [[#WebNotify][recent changes alert]].

The preferred place to configure e-mail is in the [[%SCRIPTURLPATH{"configure"}%][configure =Mail= tab]] tool (=LocalSite.cfg=). The configure tool fully documents these setting.

The notify e-mail uses the default =changes.tmpl= template, or a skin if activated by a [[%SYSTEMWEB%.PreferenceSettings][preference setting]].

=mailnotify= also relies on a hidden file in each =data/Web= directory: =.changes= and a file with the Web name (one per web) in the =working/work_areas/MailerContrib/= directory. Make sure both are writable by your web server process. =.changes= contains a list of changes;  The file in the =working/work_areas/MailerContrib/= directorycontains a timestamp of the last time notification was done for the web.Both files are automatically created as needed.

---++++ Legacy and current configuration

<div class="foswikiHelp">
%X% *Caution:* Older versions of Foswiki, and especially TWiki migrations might configure e-mail in the [[%SYSTEMWEB%.PreferenceSettings][preference settings]] topic.Make sure you delete that setting if you are using a %LOCALSITEPREFS% topic from a previous release of Foswiki.   *These settings are no longer used and have been removed*.
</div>

%TABLE{sort="off"}%
| *Parameter* | *[[%SCRIPTURLPATH{"configure"}%][configure]]<br />(Current)* | *[[%SYSTEMWEB%.PreferenceSettings][preference settings]]<br />(Legacy)* | *Default* | *Description* |
| Global enable | ={EnableEmail}= | _n/a_ | =enabled= | Globally enable/disable email support. |
| Extermal mail program | ={MailProgram}=  | _n/a_ | ='/usr/sbin/sendmail -t -oi -oeq'= | E-mail program used when Net:SMTP is unavailable |
| Mail relay host | ={SMTP}{MAILHOST}= | =SMTPMAILHOST= | _not set_ | Destination SMTP Server used to receive and relay email. Net::SMTP is disabled if this is not set. |
| Mail sending hostname | ={SMTP}{SENDERHOST}= | =SMTPSENDERHOST= | _not set_ | Hostname used to identify sender. Some SMTP configurations will require this. |
| SMTP Password | ={SMTP}{Password}= | _not supported_ | _not set_ |

---+++ Setting the automatic e-mail schedule

*For Unix platforms:* Edit the =cron= table so that =mailnotify= is called in an interval of your choice. Please consult =man crontab= for how to modify the table that schedules program execution at certain intervals. Example:
<verbatim class="bash">
% crontab -e
0 1 * * * (cd /path/to/bin; ./mailnotify -q)</verbatim>

The above line will run mailnotify nightly at 01:00. The =-q= switch suppresses all normal output.

*For ISP installations:* Many ISPs don't allow hosted accounts direct cron access, as it's often used for things that can heavily load the server. Workaround scripts are available.

*On Windows:* You can use a scheduled task if you have administrative privileges.

---++ Site Permissions

   * AccessControl describes how to restrict read and write access to topics and webs, by users and groups
   * SitePermissions lists the permissions settings of the webs on this site

---++ Help with crontab

The crontab command is used to schedule commands to be executed periodically.
