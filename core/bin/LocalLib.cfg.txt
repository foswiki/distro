# LocalLib.cfg: local path settings for Foswiki

use vars qw( $foswikiLibPath $CPANBASE );

#development and debugging settings
#$ENV{FOSWIKI_ASSERTS} = 1;
#$ENV{FOSWIKI_MONITOR} = 1;

# -------------- Path to lib directory containing Foswiki.pm. 
#
# REQUIRED
# The absolute path to the 'lib' directory in your installation..
# Windows users:  Use forward slash - C:/absolute/path/to/lib
#                 backslash like C:\ will not work

$foswikiLibPath = '/absolute/path/to/your/lib';


# -------------- Extra path components to include in @INC
# The actual Foswiki "@INC library path" can be found in the "configure" section
# "Web Server Environment".

# OPTIONAL
# By default Foswiki ships some CPAN modules in "$foswikiLibPath/CPAN/lib".
# These modules will be used unless $CPANBASE is properly set by uncommenting
# the following definition and providing an existing alternative path. If the
# path does not exist (invalid value) then Foswiki won't use any such path and
# if the setting is uncommented but left empty (undefined) then the default path
# will be prepended to the "@INC library path" while by default it is appended.

# $CPANBASE = '/path/to/dir';         # Keep commented: Default path appended
# $CPANBASE = '/path/to/dir';         # Uncommented: Your path appended
# $CPANBASE = '/path/to/invalid/dir'; # Uncommented: Invalid, nothing added
# $CPANBASE = '';                     # Uncommented: Default path prepended


# OPTIONAL
# If you need to use perl modules that are not installed in the standard
# directories (e.g. you have downloaded extra modules for use with plugins)
# then you can add the absolute paths to those modules below. You can list
# as many directories as you want, each directory within quotes, and 
# directories separated by commas.

# @localPerlLibPath = ( '/path/to/dir', '/path/to/another/dir', );


# OPTIONAL
# If you want to remove some paths from Foswiki @INC (e.g. you put modules
# in different locations and want to quickly move them away while not
# changing e.g. $foswikiLibPath) then add absolute paths to be removed below.
# Do not use this to remove a system wide perl installation in favor of a
# complete local perl installation, but change the shebang line of scripts
# in foswiki/bin and foswiki/tools (see foswiki/tools/rewriteshebang.pl).
# Please note the exact behaviour of "no lib" as described under:
# http://perldoc.perl.org/lib.html#Deleting-directories-from-@INC
# You can list as many directories as you want, each directory within
# quotes, and directories separated by commas.

# no lib ( '/path/to/dir', '/path/to/another/dir', );


# HINTS
# If you prefer to have each path on a single line then you could add a
# linebreak instead of the spaces between the parentheses e.g.:
# <above OPTIONAL setting> (
#       '/path/to/dir',
#       '/path/to/another/dir',
#       );


# http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2002/04/10/mod_perl.html?page=3 has good advice
# on installing CPAN modules without superuser privileges.
# http://sial.org/howto/perl/life-with-cpan/non-root/ also provides a good
# overview and especially mentions additional modules interesting for
# non-root installations (e.g. App::perlbrew, local::lib, App::FatPacker,
# App::cpanminus and other tools).
