---+!! Slide Show Plugin

%SHORTDESCRIPTION%

%TOC%

---++ Introduction

There is already a defacto standard for presentations, why this plugin? This plugin makes sense for organizations that do already have lots of content in Foswiki: It is easy to create a web based presentation that contains many links to related content. The plugin does not try to compete with the bells and whistles of the other presentation program, but the markup of Foswiki and other plugins like Foswiki:Extensions/ChartPlugin, Foswiki:Extensions/GaugePlugin, Foswiki:Extensions/SpreadSheetPlugin, Foswiki:Extensions/JHotDrawPlugin can be used to create appealing presentations.

Any topic with headings can be converted into a slideshow. Each slide starts with a ="---++"= heading. There are two modes to view a topic:

   * Normal topic view mode: Headings and text is shown in the usual Foswiki rendering, representing the outline of the slideshow. This mode is useful to print handouts.
   * Presentation mode: Each heading with text is shown as a slide; the format is based on a slide template. Navigation buttons are added to go to the "First", "Previous", and "Next" slide. Slide navigation is quick because it is done with anchor jumps to the same page. 

You can start the presentation by clicking on the "Start presentation" button.

---++ Syntax rules

---+++ How to create a slideshow

   * Start with =%<nop>SLIDESHOWSTART%=
      * Use the optional =template= parameter to specify your own slide template topic, e.g. =%<nop>SLIDESHOWSTART{ template="MyOwnSlideTemplate" }%=
   * Create the slides. Start each slide with a ="---++"= heading and add text like paragraphs, bullets, tables and images.
      * *Hint:* Make sure to keep each slide short enough so that you do not need to scroll to see all text of a slide during the presentation.
      * *Note:* You can use any heading level you like, but use the same for all slides.
   * End your slideshow with =%<nop>SLIDESHOWEND%=

---+++ How to create your own slide template

To create your own template topic, copy the "Default Slide Template" section below (or from [[SlideShowPluginTableTemplate]]) into your own slide template topic and customize it to your needs. It can be activated as the default template in the plugin's =TEMPLATE= setting, or per slideshow with the =%<nop>SLIDESHOWSTART{ template="MyOwnSlideTemplate" }%= setting.

   * Use a DIV or an HTML table that defines a slide. For example, create one row for the slide title, another one for the slide text.
   * These keywords can be used:
     | *Keyword* | *What it means* |
     | =%<nop>SLIDETITLE%= | The heading of the slide |
     | =%<nop>SLIDETEXT%= | The text of the slide |
     | =%<nop>SLIDECOMMENT%= | The comment of the slide (optional; appended to slide of missing) |
     | =%<nop>SLIDENUM%= | The current slide number |
     | =%<nop>SLIDEMAX%= | The last slide number |
   * Navigation buttons are automatically added at the top of the slides. Unless you use one of the following tokens, then the top navigation buttons will not be shown.
     | =%<nop>SLIDENAV%= | The navigation buttons for "First", "Previous", "Next" slide |
     | =%<nop>SLIDENAVALL%= | The navigation buttons for "First", "Previous", "Next", "Last" slide |
     | =%<nop>SLIDENAVFIRST%= | The navigation button for "First slide" |
     | =%<nop>SLIDENAVPREV%= | The navigation button for "Previous slide" |
     | =%<nop>SLIDENAVNEXT%= | The navigation button for "Next slide" |
     | =%<nop>SLIDENAVLAST%= | The navigation button for "Last slide" |
   * Only text between =%<nop>STARTINCLUDE%= and =%<nop>STOPINCLUDE%= is used for the template.

---++ Example

This is a short example of a slideshow. You should see a "Start presentation" button if this plugin is installed:

%SLIDESHOWSTART%
<!--
---++ Introduction
This is slide one. 

%TOC%

---++ Hamlet meets his father's ghost
   * Hamlet learns that his father was killed by his brother Claudius and Queen Gertrude.
   * Claudius has quickly become king.

---++ This is rather upsetting
   * The ghost demands revenge.
   * Hamlet agrees.
   * His friends swear to keep what they have seen a secret.

---++ Meanwhile...
   * the King's advisor Polonius meets his daughter Ophelia. Hamlet has upset her.
   * Hamlet is acting mad
   
---+++ Comments
   * This text is not shown in the slide if HIDECOMMENTS is set to on.
   * It can have
   * many
   * more
   * bullets

|  Change History: | <!-- versions below in reverse order -->&nbsp; |
|  19 Sep 2010 | 3.0: Arthur Clemens: Based on <nop>JQueryPlugin's [[%SYSTEMWEB%.JQueryCycle][Cycle Plugin]]. Changed implementation to use a template to make it possible to have skin overrides. The templates uses full window width and height. If no control buttons are used in the template (the new default template for instance, a new control bar at the top is displayed including a jump field to go directly to a slide number. Created legacy/fallback template SlideShowPluginTableTemplate that uses a table layout. |
|  31 Jul 2010 | Foswikitask:Item9415 - Documentation updates |
|  17 Jun 2009 | 2.0: Arthur Clemens: optimize to default template and CSS to make the plugin work with older templates. |
|  31 Mar 2009 | [[Foswiki:Main.GilmarSantosJr][GilmarSantosJr]]: [[Foswiki:Tasks/Item1401]] - Make it work in persistent environments |
|  18 Feb 2009 | Fixed =HIDECOMMENTS= to really hide the comment if value is =on= - otherwise the comment is shown in the comments section; added customizable =COMMENTS_LABEL= for all non-English speaking people. Updated default template and css; cleaned up code: now uses a =cover= instead of a =skin= so the style of the installed skin is used (unless redefined in the css file); use a custom template; when in slideshow mode, hide topic text; removed extraneously generated spaces; improved error messages; from the button "End presentation" link back to the start button. |
|  05 Feb 2009 | Updated graphics; made html and css validate. |
|  21 Jan 2009 | Exchanged the current default skin by something which is not written in totaly broken html and looking acceptable ( still needs an update, still table ugly design..). You can style using CSS now. Tuned the docs a bit. |
