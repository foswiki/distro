---+!! Include Topics and Web Pages Using =%<nop>INCLUDE{...}%= Macro

Embed topics, or subsections of topics, or other web pages.

The [[VarINCLUDE][%<nop>INCLUDE{...}%]] macro embeds the content of the specified topic at the place where the [[VarINCLUDE][INCLUDE]] is used. The whole content or only parts of of a page can be included.
<div class="foswikiHelp">
%H% If permitted in [[%SCRIPTURLPATH{"configure"}%][configure]], content from any arbitrary URL may be included also. This is disabled by default because it may be used for malicious purposes, especially on public installations.
See: _Security and Authentication > Environment >_ ={INCLUDE}{AllowURLs}=.

%H% If your web server connects to the internet via a proxy server, Proxy settings should be set in [[%SCRIPTURLPATH{"configure"}%][configure]]. See: _Security and Authentication > Proxies >_ ={PROXY}{HOST}=
</div>

---++ Syntax Example

<verbatim class="tml">
%INCLUDE{
   "page"
   pattern="reg-exp"
   rev="2"
   warn="off"
   section="clients"
   PARAMETER1="value"
   PARAMETER2="Some value"
}%
</verbatim>

The =pattern= parameter is optional and allows you to extract some parts of a web page. Specify a %SYSTEMWEB%.RegularExpression that contains the text you want to keep in parenthesis. It may be helpful for the pattern to match more than just the text you wish to keep, e.g. =pattern="Some prefix(Start here.*?to here)"=. If needed, the pattern may even scan from start (='^'=) to end and match the whole topic, e.g. =pattern="^.*?(from here.*?to here).*"=.

You need to make sure that the integrity of a web page is not compromised; for example, if you include a table, make sure to include everything including the table end tag.

The example parameters PARAMETER1 and PARAMETER2 will be defined as macros within the scope of the included topic. The example parameters shown will result in %PARAMETER1% and %PARAMETER2% being defined within the included topic.

VarINCLUDE explains the other parameters.

<div class="foswikiHelp"> %H% All text of a topic is included unless it contains a [[VarSTARTINCLUDE][%<nop>STARTINCLUDE%]] and [[VarSTOPINCLUDE][%<nop>STOPINCLUDE%]], or you specify a =section= parameter (see [[VarSTARTSECTION][STARTSECTION]] and [[VarENDSECTION][ENDSECTION]]) and/or a =pattern= parameter. A pattern will only search between =%<nop>STARTINCLUDE%= and =%<nop>STOPINCLUDE%= or within the =section= specified.</div>

---++ Usage Examples

---+++ 1. Display regression test results
<verbatim class="tml">
  <pre>
  %INCLUDE{"http://domain/~qa/v1.1/REDTest.log.txt"}%
  </pre>
</verbatim>

---+++ 2. Display foswiki.org's frequently asked questions

   * You type:
<verbatim class="tml">
  %INCLUDE{"https://foswiki.org/Support/FrequentlyAskedQuestion?skin=text"}%
</verbatim>

   * You get:
%INCLUDE{"https://foswiki.org/Support/FrequentlyAskedQuestion?skin=text"}%

<div class="foswikiHelp">%X% Including URLs is disabled by default as it presents a security risk. It may be enabled via [[%SCRIPTURLPATH{"configure"}%][configure]]. _Only enable this if you understand the risk_.</div>

---+++ 3. Include a topic

   * You type:
<verbatim class="tml">
  %INCLUDE{"%SYSTEMWEB%.TipsOfTheDayInclude"}%
</verbatim>

   * You get:
%INCLUDE{"%SYSTEMWEB%.TipsOfTheDayInclude"}%

---+++ 4. Include a topic !MyTopic with two parameters

You include the topic with this line
<verbatim class="tml">
  %INCLUDE{"MyTopic" BETTER="apples" WORSE="Oranges"}%
</verbatim>

An example of a very simple !MyTopic could contain

<verbatim class="tml">
   * I like %BETTER% better than %WORSE%.
</verbatim> 

The result would be

   * I like apples better than oranges.
