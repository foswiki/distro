%SHORTDESCRIPTION%

%TOC%

---++ Usage

This plugin is installed with the PatchFoswikContrib.  It implements a single
macro: %<nop>PATCHREPORT%.  This is an Admin only macro that reports on the
patches installed on this system.

%STARTSECTION{"patchreport"}%
---++ Patch files found on this system

This report lists the patch files found in the =working/configure/patch=
directory.  The patch summary is displayed, followed by a list of each
candidate patch.  The *Status* column is set to:
   * *N/A*: This version of the patch does not apply to this file. The file might have been subsequently modified by another patch or by manual edit.
   * *PATCHED*: The patch appears to have been applied, and no other modifications have been made to the file.
   * *APPLIES*: The patch matches and is eligible to be applied.

If you dont' see a report here, then verify that PatchFoswikiContribPlugin is enabled in the configuration.
