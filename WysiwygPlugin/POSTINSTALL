This package includes the Kupu WYSIWYG editor. This is a powerful
cross-browser editor that works in IE and Mozilla-based browsers.

Full installation of Kupu requires that you run the Kupu makefile.
This is not required for Foswiki, but is required if you want a full
installation of Kupu for other reasons. For further details, read
the documentation in the pub/_kupu/doc directory in your installation.
