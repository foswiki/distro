---+ Using HTML

When, and how, to use HTML in topics.

%STARTINCLUDE%
You can use most HTML tags in topics without a problem. This is useful where you want to
add some content that is formatted in a way that is not supported using [[wiki syntax]], for example,
you can write =&lt;del&gt;deleted text&lt;/del&gt;= to get <del>deleted text</del>.

There are a few usability and technical considerations to keep in mind:
   * On collaboration pages, it's better *not* to use HTML, but to use [[wiki syntax]] instead -
     this keeps the text uncluttered and easy to edit using the plaintext editor.
   * If you _must_ use HTML, try to stick to [[http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/][XHTML 1.0 Transitional]] syntax.
   * Even if your site allows it, avoid using Javascript.
   * Use =&lt;literal&gt;..&lt;/literal&gt;= tags around blocks of HTML to avoid accidental interpretation of
     [[Wiki syntax]] within the HTML.
<div class="foswikiHelp">%X% Script tags may be filtered out, at the discretion of your Wiki administrator.</div>

Recommendations when pasting HTML from other sources (using the plain-text editor):
   * Copy only text between =&lt;body&gt;= and =&lt;/body&gt;= tags.
   * Remove all empty lines. Foswiki inserts =&lt;p /&gt;= paragraph tags on empty lines, which causes problems if done between HTML tags that do not allow paragraph tags, like for example between table tags.
   * Remove leading spaces. Foswiki might interpret some text as lists.
   * Do not span a tag over more than one line. Foswiki requires that the opening and closing angle brackets - ==&lt;...&gt;== - of a HTML tag are on the same line, or the tag will be broken.
   * In your HTML editing program, save without hard line breaks on text wrap.

When using a WYSIWYG editor, you can just copy-paste directly into the editor, and the content will
be converted to [[wiki syntax]] automatically when you save.
