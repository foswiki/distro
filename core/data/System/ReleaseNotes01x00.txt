---+!! Foswiki Release 1.0.2 - 26 Feb 2009

%TOC%

---++ Foswiki - The Free and Open Source Wiki

Foswiki is an enterprise collaboration and information sharing tool targeted for professional use in many types of companies: from small businesses to large organizations.

Foswiki is a wiki: fundamentally, a website with editable web pages. It looks like a normal web site but it encourages contributions, edits, updates, questions, and answers from its users. It's a powerful way of enabling a community to communicate asynchronously using intranet and public internet websites. Foswiki is simple to learn and use. It aims to provide a transparent way for you to publish and exchange your ideas with others over the web and eliminates the one-webmaster syndrome of outdated intranet content.

Foswiki is a structured wiki with tools that enable users without programming skills to build powerful yet simple applications to process information and support workflows. Developers can extend the functionality of Foswiki with plugins.

Foswiki is the old TWiki project under a new name. Restrictions on the use of the TWiki brand resulted in many of its developers continuing the project under the new Foswiki name. Foswiki is backwards compatible with all content from older TWiki installations. Foswiki 1.0 ships with a !TWikiCompatibilityPlugin installed and activated by default, thus enabling most extensions made for TWiki to work under Foswiki. Foswiki is released under the GNU General Public License.

---++ Foswiki 1.0 Releases

   * Foswiki 1.0.0, the first Foswiki was released on 09 Jan 2009.
   * Foswiki 1.0.1 was released internally in the development community 23 Feb 2009 but we found a few important bugs that made us decide not to publish it and instead release a 1.0.2. It is a patch release with around 70 bug fixes and only very few minor enhancements.
   * Foswiki 1.0.2 was built 25 Feb 2009 and published 27 Feb 2009. It is a patch release with around 80 bug fixes relative to 1.0.0 and only very few minor enhancements. 

---++ Pre-installed Extensions

Foswiki 1.0.2 is shipped with the following:

   * *Plugins:* !CommentPlugin, !EditTablePlugin, !EmptyPlugin, !InterwikiPlugin, !PreferencesPlugin, !RenderListPlugin, !SlideShowPlugin, !SmiliesPlugin, !SpreadSheetPlugin, !TablePlugin, !TinyMCEPlugin, !TwistyPlugin, !WysiwygPlugin
   * *Contribs:* !BehaviourContrib, !JSCalendarContrib, !MailerContrib, !TipsContrib, !TopicUserMappingContrib
   * *Skins:* !PatternSkin
   * *Compatibility support* - !TWikiCompatibilityPlugin

---++ What's new &mdash; highlights

   * Foswiki 1.0 is built on a new platform called [[Foswiki:Development.FoswikiStandAlone][Foswiki Stand Alone]] which adds support for [[Foswiki:Extensions.FastCGIEngineContrib][FastCGI]] and enables more optimized functionality in mod_perl and other similar runtime environments. Foswiki Stand Alone also enables future features such as running Foswiki by itself without a separate web server (for example, from a stand alone memory key). You can ensure your applications and plugins will work properly on the new platform (and thus with any future capabilities dependent on the new architecture) by testing them out now with Foswiki 1.0.
   * A !TWikiCompatibilityPlugin has been created that enables most extensions made for TWiki to work under Foswiki, and to support seamless migrations from TWiki to Foswiki.
   * The !PatternSkin has been given a facelift: The !PatternSkin topic offers a choice of multiple themes, the sidebar can be placed either on the left or right, a frame can be added around the main content area, and a TWiki theme is available to make it easier for those upgrading from TWiki (dimensions such as the top bar size match the dimensions in the TWiki !PatternSkin).
   * The "Advanced Search" page now supports a query-based search.
   * A new section type, "expandvariables", adds better control over macro expansion in topic templates. You can now create template topics with sections where all macros contained within the sections are expanded.
   * A "Copy topic" feature is now present in the "More topic actions" tools.
   * IF conditions has been expanded with an "isempty" test condition.
   * =viewfile= script can be used as a webserver _ErrorDocument_ enabling both more secure attachments and user focused error dialogs.
   * The Foswiki tgz / zip distribution file now has a top-level directory &mdash; Foswiki-x.y.z (x.y.z representing the version) &mdash; in which all of its files and subdirectories are contained.

---+++ Security Updates

Foswiki is much more secure than TWiki 4.2.4.

   * Foswiki 1.0 has secured by default the powerful but also vulnerable URLPARAM macro against cross site scripting (XSS) attacks. URLPARAM now by default encodes a short list of unsafe characters ='"&lt;&gt;%= which eliminates most XSS possibilities encountered with URLPARAM. This protects all topics using the URLPARAM macro without requiring any changes to them.
   * Functions QUERYPARAMS, ORIGURL (skin macro) are secured against XSS attacks. QUERYPARAMS, like URLPARAM, is now encoded with the new, safe encoding.
   * The print preview link is no longer vulnerable to XSS attacks.
   * Additional security fixes have been made, based on security audits performed by the Foswiki team. Sensitive data from the topic text and web client requests are validated for safety.

---+++ Upgrading From TWiki 4.2

Foswiki is compatible with content of TWiki releases up to and including 4.2, as part of its design.

As part of the creation of the Foswiki project, the Foswiki community is evaluating all of the hundreds of extensions that are available for TWiki. All that are working are ported over to the Foswiki name space. Many of them are being enhanced through the removal of bugs and security vulnerabilities, resulting in better, more functional plugins for Foswiki. The most popular plugins are already ported and more are added every day.

---++ Terminology changes in Foswiki

As part of the first Foswiki product release, various topics and terms were changed to avoid using the TWiki brand name and to more accurately reflect their purpose, including the following:

   * The TWiki web is now called System, as it contains configuration information for the entire Foswiki installation. The !TWikiCompatibilityPlugin provides backwards compatible support for references to the TWiki web, in order to facilitate migrations from TWiki to Foswiki.
   * The %<nop>TWIKIWEB% and %<nop>MAINWEB% variables are now called %<nop>SYSTEMWEB% and %<nop>USERSWEB%
   * Topics in the Foswiki distribution have been renamed to eliminate the TWiki word and to make the titles more readable (for example, Plugins, Skins, and so forth).
   * All templates, CSS and Javascript names have been changed from twikiXxxxx to foswikiXxxxx
   * Key terminology changes:
| *TWiki term* | *Foswiki term* |
| TWiki variable | Macro |
| preference(s) variable | preference setting, or macro when referring to expansion of same |
| TWiki form | Data form |
| TWiki Plugin | Plugin |
| TWiki Template | Skin Template |
| Topic Template | Template Topic |
| TWiki Markup Language (TML) | Topic Markup Language (TML) |
| TWiki Application | Wiki Application |

---+++ Topic names changed in System web (former TWiki web)

<noautolink>
| *Old name* | *New name* |
| TWikiAdminGroup | AdminGroup |
| TWikiGroupTemplate | GroupTemplate |
| TWikiPreferences | SitePreferences |
| TWikiGroups | WikiGroups |
| TWikiContributor | ProjectContributor |
| TWikiUsers | WikiUsers |
| TWikiGuest | WikiGuest |
| TWikiRegistrationAgent | RegistrationAgent |
| TWikiAdminUser | AdminUser |

Note that the change from TWikiAdminGroup to AdminGroup has no practical implication when upgrading from TWiki to Foswiki. The topics with an ALLOW setting set to TWikiAdminGroup will still prevent users from accessing or editing and the AdminGroup members can edit anything. You must however make sure the TWikiAdminGroup topic exists in the Main web and that it is protected against editing: when migrating, make sure it is copied over from the old Main web along with all other user and group topics.

When you upgrade from TWiki, copy the old TWikiUsers topic to WikiUsers and manually add the AdminUser, ProjectContributor, and RegistrationAgent users.

Your old Main.TWikiPreferences settings must be copied to the new Main.SitePreferences topic. </noautolink>

---++ Important Changes since Foswiki 1.0.0

Fixed 70 bugs since Foswiki 1.0.0. Quite many of these are bugs that originate from TWiki 4.2.3. The most important bugs are 
   * Fixed some bugs related to expired sessions and date in session cookies.
   * Fixed a number of bugs in configure related to installation of extensions
   * Fixed a bug that prevented proper operation with https
   * Fixed a bug related to VIEW_TEMPLATE and preview
   * Enhanced the user interface of configure
   * Added approx. 30 more bugs to the list of bugs fixed in 1.0.0 that we missed in the 1.0.0 version of these release notes.

See full list of fixed bugs below.

---++ Important Changes since TWiki 4.2.3

If this release had been a TWiki release it would have been 4.3.0

Since the fork of Foswiki happened while TWiki 4.2.3 was the current release, all changes since this release are listed below.
