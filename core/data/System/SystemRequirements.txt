---+!! Foswiki System Requirements
%STARTINCLUDE%

Low client and server base requirements are core features that keep Foswiki widely deployable, particularly across a range of browser platforms and versions. Many extensions exist which enhance and expand Foswiki's capabilities; they may have additional requirements.

%TOC{title="Contents"}%

---+++ Server Requirements

Foswiki is written in Perl 5, which is supported on Microsoft Windows as well as Unix and Unix-like systems (including Linux and OSX), on which it uses a number of shell commands and <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/rcs/rcs.html" rel="nofollow" target="_top">RCS (Revision Control System)</a>, a GNU Free Software package. It should be able to run on any server platform that meets the following requirements.

| *Resource* | *Required Server Environment* |
| Perl | 5.8.8 or higher |
| RCS | 5.7 or higher (including GNU =diff=) <br /> Optional. Foswiki includes a pure Perl implementation of RCS (RcsLite) that can be used instead, at the cost of performance |
| GNU diff | GNU diff 2.7 or higher is required when not using the all-Perl RcsLite. <br /> Install within the PATH if not included with RCS (check version with =diff -v=) <br /> Must be the version used by RCS, to avoid problems with binary attachments - RCS may have hard-coded path to =diff= |
| Other external programs | =fgrep, egrep= |
| Cron/scheduler | &bull; Unix: =cron= <br />&bull; Windows: =cron= equivalents <!-- SMELL: Macintosh version? --> |
| Web server | Apache is well supported; for information on other servers, see Foswiki:Support.InstallingOnSpecificPlatforms. |

---+++ Perl Modules

A complete list of the required and optional Perl modules can be found in =lib/DEPENDENCIES=.

The following CPAN modules are not shipped with Foswiki. Note that Foswiki extensions may add additional requirements.
Modules marked as Required may still be optional if certain default core features are not used.

| *Module* | *Required/Optional* | *Description* |
| CGI::Session | Required | Sessions support is usually required. |
| HTML::Entities | Required | Used for [[Foswiki:Extensions.WysiwygPlugin][WYSIWYG Editing]] |
| HTML::Parser | Required | Used for [[Foswiki:Extensions.WysiwygPlugin][WYSIWYG Editing]] |
| HTML::Tree | Required | Used by CompareRevisionAddOn. |
| URI | Required | Used for email notifications of topic changes. [[Foswiki::Extensions.MailerContrib][MailerContrib]] |
| LWP | Required | Used by the Configure Extensions Installer, and for external URL based INCLUDEs |
| Digest::SHA | Optional | Required to use SHA1 password encoding, since Perl 5.9.3 part of core |
| Crypt::PasswdMD5 | Optional | Required to use Apache or Crypt MD5 password encoding, and crypt encoding on Windows |
| Win32::Console | Optional | May be required for I18N on Windows |
| Archive::Tar | Optional | Required by the Extensions Installer in configure if command line tar or unzip is not available, since Perl 5.9.3 part of core. |
| Archive::Zip | Optional | Alternative to Archive::Tar, used by the Extensions Installer if Archive::Tar and command line tar and unzip also unavailable |
| Net::SMTP::SSL | Optional | Required by Net::SMPT to send email over SSL to providers such as gmail. |
| Authen::SASL | Optional | Required by Net::SMTP if email server requires authentication. |


Most of them will probably already be available in your installation. You can check version numbers with the =configure= script, or if you're still trying to get to that point, check from the command line like this:
<verbatim class="bash">
perl -e 'use FileHandle; print $FileHandle::VERSION."\n"'
</verbatim>
For more detailed dependency information, try the script =dependencies_installer.pl= located in the =tools= directory, which makes perl module installation easier. Run it with option =-h= to understand basics. This script requires confirmation before it actually does something.

#ClientRequirements
---+++ Client Requirements

The [[InstallationGuide][standard installation]] has relatively low browser requirements:

   * XHTML 1.0 Transitional compliant
   * Cookies, if persistent sessions are required
   * Javascript, for edit/save/upload functionality <blockquote class="foswikiHelp">%T% Change ={ValidationMethod}{Method}= from =strikeone= to =embedded= in [[%SCRIPTURLPATH{"configure"}%][configure]] to allow non-javascript browsers to edit/save/upload</blockquote>

CSS and Javascript are used in most skins. Some skins will require more recent releases of browsers. The default skin is tested on IE 6+, Safari, Chrome and Firefox.

You can easily select a balance of browser capability versus look and feel. Try the installed skins at %SYSTEMWEB%.SkinBrowser and more at Foswiki:Extensions.SkinPackage.
