# (installed by the PlainFileStoreContrib) is just about the simplest store
# that you can use with Foswiki. it uses simple text files to store
# the history of topics and attachments, and does not require any external
# programs. The use of text files makes it easy to implement 'out of band'
# processing, as well as taking maximum advantage of filestore caching. This
# is the reference implementation of a store.</dd></dl>

# **BOOLEAN LABEL="Check for RCS"**
# Check before every store modification that there are no suspicious
# files left over from RCS. This check should be enabled whenever there
# is a risk that old RCS data has been mixed in to a PlainFileStore.
