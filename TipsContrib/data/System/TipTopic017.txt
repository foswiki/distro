Foswiki has "Soft security" - anyone can change anything, but changes are logged.  There is a complete audit trail:
   * Version
   * Date of last revision
   * Person who made change
is recorded. At the footer of each topic one can click on previous versions. One can also see the differences between revisions by clicking on the <u>&gt;</u> sign located between revisions of a topic.
