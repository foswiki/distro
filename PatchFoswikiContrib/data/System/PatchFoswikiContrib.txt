---++ Usage

This extension allows you to "hotfix" urgent issues on your Foswiki system.  It has been tested on Foswiki 1.1.0 and beyond.  It does not work on Foswiki 1.0.

When this extension is installed, it adds some required libraries to your Foswiki system, and includes a plugin to display an inventory of patches on the system.  This extension does not ship with any patches.

Patches are only applied if the target file is an _exact_ match to the original file.  There is no attempt to do "fuzzy" patching.

There is no "dependency" between patches.  Patches are installed in order of their patch file name. 

Patches will be mapped from the default Foswiki filename to the directory location used on the target system.

Before any file is patched, a backup is copied to =working/configure/backup/&lt;Itemxxxx-nnn-YYYMMDD-HHMMSS&gt;=.  If archive tools are found on the system, a zip or tar archive is created of the backup.

---++ Building a patch

A separate version of a patch extension has to be built for each patch.  The only patches installed are those identified in the manifest of the Extension.  This extension adds some infrastructure that a future Foswiki could
use to apply patches from configure.

---+++ Create a patch file

The format of the patch file is a collection of related patches, one for each
version of a target file.  The patch file consists of

   $ Summary: A general description of the patch.  It can be any number of lines long and will be reported in the installation log.
   $ Patch Target =~~~PATCH fdeeb7f236608b7792ad0845bf2279f9:76e28354522a6d6cccc76c66f99d2424  lib/Foswiki/Configure/Dependency.pm (Foswiki 1.1.5)=:  Identifies a single version of a patch along with the md5 of the target file, the filename and a comment.
      * =~~~PATCH= Identifies this as a patch
      * =fdee..79f9= is the MD5 hash of the original version of the unpatched target file.
      * =fdee..2424= is the MD5 hash of the patched version of the file.
      * =lib/Foswiki...= The target file name
      * =(Comment)= A comment in optional parenthesis, such as the foswiki version that shipped this file..
   $ The patch:  A patch in unified diff format =diff -Naur oldversionFile newVersionFile

To build a patch file,
   * For the "current release":
      * Calculate checksum of original released file: =md5sum lib/Foswiki/Target/File.pm >> Itemxxxx-xxx.patch=
      * Get a starting point from the fixing git patch: =git show [hash] lib/Foswiki/Target/File.pm >> Itemxxxx-xxx.patch=
      * Verify that this diff can be applied to the "released" version of the file
      * Edit the patch file buiding the ~~~PATCH record and remove the md5sum record

   * For each additional release that the patch will cover:
      * Calculate checksum of original file: =md5sum lib/Foswiki/Target/File.pm >> Itemxxxx-xxx.patch=
         * If this is identical to another revision,  you are done,  move to the next version.
      * Copy the target:   =cp lib/Foswiki/Target/File.pm lib/Foswiki/Target/File.pm.new=
      * Manually patch the new file
      * Calculate the diff: =diff -Naur lib/Foswiki/Target/File.pm lib/Foswiki/Target/File.pm.new >> Itemxxxx-xxx.patch=
      * Edit the patch file to build the ~~~PATCH record and remove the md5sum record.
