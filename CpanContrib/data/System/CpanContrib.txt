---+!! Cpan Contrib

%SHORTDESCRIPTION%

Versions of Foswiki prior to 1.2 shipped a subset of the Perl CPAN modules required to run Foswiki. As of Foswiki 1.2, these CPAN modules have been removed from =&lt;foswiki_install_dir&gt;/lib/CPAN/lib=. 
On systems where you are not permitted to install CPAN modules, you can install this contrib to provide the majority of the Foswiki Perl dependencies.  However if it's possible to install CPAN modules, 
we recommend installing them locally rather than installing this Contrib.

This contrib ships with all CPAN modules that are required for a fully functional default Foswiki installation, __with the following exceptions:__

   * =bcrypt= encryption cannot be used for local password storage. CPAN:Crypt::Eksblowfish::Bcrypt is not provided. Note that use of =bcrypt= is unusual, but a warning will be displayed in configure.
   * WYSIWYG editing will not be usable. The CPAN:HTML::Parser and CPAN:HTML::Entities modules are not provided.
   * SSL Email will not be functional (required to use Google's gmail as an email service).  CPAN:Net::SSLeay is not included.

These modules are not provided because they are not available in a "pure perl" implemenation and must be compiled for the target system.  In addition, CPAN:Net::SSLeay has dependencies on the non-perl package !OpenSSL.

---++ Installation

This extension will typically require a special installation procedure.  Because this extension provides critical perl dependencies, the Foswiki
extension installer will typically not be functional.

To install this extension, download the zip or tgz file from the [[http://foswiki.org/Extensions/CpanContrib][Foswiki Extensions repository]], and unzip / untar the downloaded file into the foswiki
installation. If Foswiki encounters errors because these modules are incompatible with the installed perl, you may need to follow the steps in =bin/LocalLib.cfg.txt= to add these libs to the front of the search path,
overriding the system provided modules.

---++ Updating this extension with current CPAN modules

This extension was built using the =cpanm= tool provided by =App::cpanminus=

cd into the CpanContrib directory and then build the dependencies:
<verbatim>
cpanm --pp -L . --self-contained --exclude-vendor Algorithm::Diff Archive::Tar Archive::Zip CGI CGI::Session Crypt::PasswdMD5 Digest::SHA Error File::Copy::Recursive
cpanm --pp -L . --self-contained --exclude-vendor HTML::Parser HTML::Tree IO::Socket::IP Locale::Maketext::Lexicon Locale::Msgfmt LWP Socket version URI
</verbatim>

This will compile the modules into =lib/perl5=.   Move the contents of =lib/perl5= into =lib/CPAN/lib=.  If this is being built for portable use,
remove any architecure specific directories, such as =x86_64-linux= Files such as =.pod= documentation can also be removed.
