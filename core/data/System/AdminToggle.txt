---+ Group Member Toggle

This topic implements a button that will turn Admin status on or off for the
current user (!%WIKINAME%), by adding or removing the user from the
!AdminGroup.  This new function is recommended to replace _internal admin_ login when
possible.  It provides better security and allows changes to be tracked to the
user making the change instead of the anonymous !AdminUser.

%T% This is actually a generic capability.  Any group membership can be toggled using this function.

<div class='foswikiHelp'>
  %T% Note: This feature is only usable if your User Mapper allows group membership to be modified from the Wiki.
</div>

---++ Configuration
   * Edit the settings for %USERSWEB%.AdminGroup
      * Allow the users who are permitted to gain "Admin Rights" to modify the topic.
      * Ex. =* ALLOWTOPICCHANGE = !AdminGroup, !JoeTheAdmin, !AnotherAdmin=
   * Remove those users from the !AdminGroup. They can add themselves using the below button.
   * Notify the potential administrators that they can either use this topic, or =%I<nop>NCLUDE{"AdminToggle"}%= in their custom sidebar topic, or somewhere else convenient.

---++ Operation

_If you (<nop>%WIKINAME%) has permission to change the %USERSWEB%.AdminGroup topic,  a button to add or remove yourself from the !AdminGroup will appear below:_
Be sure that you have explicit CHANGE authority on the !AdminGroup or removing yourself from the group will be permanent.
