#VarLANGUAGE
---+++ LANGUAGE -- language code for the current user
   * Returns the language code for the current user. This is the language used by Foswiki to generate the user interface.
   * The language is detected from the user's browser, unless some site/web/user/session-defined preference setting overrides it:
      * If a =LANGUAGE= preference is explicitly set, this will be used as the user language instead of any language detected from the browser.
      * %X% Avoid defining =LANGUAGE= in a non- per-user way, otherwise users will not be able to choose their preferred language.
   * Do not confuse =LANGUAGE= with [[VarLANG][LANG]]
   * Syntax: =%<nop>LANGUAGE%=
   * Expands to: %LANGUAGE%
   * Related: [[%IF{"'%INCLUDINGTOPIC%'='Macros'" then="#"}%VarLANGUAGES][LANGUAGES]]
