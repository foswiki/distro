A short list of hints and recommendations that are considered basic knowledge when starting to edit existing topics.

#SignAndDate
   * If a *discussion* is going on:
      * separate each follow-up with a blank line
      * add your WikiName and the date at the end. Example:%BR%
        =-- <nop>%WIKIUSERNAME% - %SERVERTIME{$day $mon $year}%=
      * OR, by all means, insert your comment where it seems to fit best:
         * you may want to insert it with a bullet and/or _set it in italics_ so it's clear (always sign and date)
      * if you'd like to use an initial, use a link with label. Example:%BR%
        =-- [<nop>[%WIKIUSERNAME%][ZXQ]] - %SERVERTIME{$day $mon $year}%=

   * A good format for a *new topic* is "dissertation followed by discussion": 
      * start with a brief, factual introduction, followed by double horizontal rules
      * let the discussion begin

   * When a discussion dies down and the page becomes static, if you're clear on your course, feel free to *refactor mercilessly*:
      * fearlessly edit down to capture the key points
      * reduce the noise without losing the facts or the flavor
      * if you merge or delete comments, group credit =Contributors:= at the end of the page
      * _This is how Wiki content matures and grows in value over time._

   * For *external site links*, you can type URLs directly into the text - =http://etcete.ra/...= - it'll be clear to anyone where they're headed on click. 

   * Foswiki is intended for world-wide use, and an internationally understood date format like ==01 Sep %SERVERTIME{$year}%== or ==%SERVERTIME{$year}%-09-01== is preferred. It's clearer than the xx/xx/xx format, where a date like 9/1/01 can mean either Jan or Sep, depending on the local conventions of the readers. For months, use the first three letters: Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr,...

   * Check the source when you want to find out how something is formatted: click ==[View wiki text]== on the toolbar.
   * To see earlier versions, click either on ==[History]== (to see all previous versions of a topic) or click on the revision number you would like to see; the formatted revision version will be shown. 
   * To see the source of a previous revision, click ==[More topic actions]==, then at =View previous topic revision=, enter the revision number, mark the =in raw text format= checkbox and click ==[View]==. A bit of HTML experience can't hurt, but you'll soon see with [[TopicMarkupLanguage][TML]] how far that is from necessary.
