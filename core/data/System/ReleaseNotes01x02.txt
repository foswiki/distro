---++ Foswiki - The Free and Open Source Wiki

Foswiki is an enterprise collaboration and information sharing tool targeted for professional use in many types of organizations: from small businesses to multi-nationals, from one-product open source groups, to worldwide research networks.

Foswiki is a wiki: fundamentally, a website with editable web pages. It looks like a normal web site but it encourages contributions, edits, updates, questions, and answers from its users. It's a powerful way of enabling a community to communicate asynchronously using intranet and public internet websites. Foswiki is simple to learn and use. It aims to provide a transparent way for you to publish and exchange your ideas with others over the web and eliminates the one-webmaster syndrome of outdated intranet content.

Foswiki is a structured wiki with tools that enable users without programming skills to build powerful yet simple applications to process information and support workflows. Developers can extend the functionality of Foswiki with plugins.

Foswiki is the old TWiki project under a new name. Restrictions on the use of the TWiki brand resulted in many of its developers continuing the project under the new Foswiki name. Foswiki is backwards compatible with all content from older TWiki installations. Foswiki 1.1 ships with a !TWikiCompatibilityPlugin, thus enabling most extensions made for TWiki to work under Foswiki. Since the start of the Foswiki project there have been several releases of TWiki, However there have been very few functionality changes, and the useful changes have all been tracked in Foswiki, so topics and wiki applications supported by TWiki should also work with Foswiki.

Foswiki is released under the GNU General Public License.

#Release01x02Changes
---++ Important changes since Foswiki 1.2
   * users can authenticate via 'TemplateLogin' with their email address

---+++ Configure has been given a major restructuring

   * Configure now requires JavaScript.  
      * Configuration parameters are Checked and saved through ajax.
      * Configure only transmits changed settings, greatly reducing the required bandwith and improving performance.
   * Configure has been changed to behave more like a classic "shopping cart"
      * Changes are kept in your session, you can leave and return without loosing pending changes.
      * Pending changes can be checked, before being saved.
      * A log message describing the cnanges can be annotated during save.
   * Settings are checked through several mechanisms
      * Traditional: all settings are checked when configure is intially loaded.
      * On demand: A manual "Check this setting" button is provided for some resource intensive checkers. (ex. File permission checking)
      * Automatic: Some fields are auto-checked as soon as you tab away.  (Numbers, Regular expressions)
      * New "Configuration Audit" centrailzes several overall system health check buttons, and allows all checkers to be run again on demand.
      * The error summary counts are now buttons, which pop up a list of the errors
   * Performance
      * Javascript minimzies the  data transmitted to/from the client.  The entire configuration is not sent for each transaction.
      * Configure now supports etags and will return option 302 for resources that are cached by the browser.

---++++ Changes to confgigure Authentication

   * Configure requires a password to access the configuration.  
   * Configure now trusts the Session login.   If your web server is configured to authenticate the user, configure will not prompt for a password
   * The "admin" superuser password is now optional:
      * If set, configure requires that it be entered to save
      * If not set, configure depends solely upon the session authentication
      * By not setting, or by clearing the admin password, sites can disable the "sudo" admin login, eliminating sharing of admin passwords.

---+++ Query Search
The undocumented shortcut notation to reference to a form name is no longer available. Previously you could write:
<verbatim>
%SEARCH{
	type="query"
	"BlogPostForm"
}%
</verbatim>
Because this could lead to undeterministic behaviour, the syntax is now more controlled. You now have to refer to the form name:
<verbatim>
%SEARCH{
	type="query"
	"form.name='BlogPostForm'"
}%
</verbatim>

---+++ Major change to ICON macro and templates
Foswiki:Development.HtmlAttributesShouldUseSingleQuotes has changed the ICON
macro to generate singe quotes by default.  This has no impact unless the
%ICON macro is being expanded inside a single-quote delimited macro.  

In order to simplify migration, a new =quote== parameter has been added to the
ICON macro. =%<nop>ICON{"pdf" quote="\""}%= generates the html using double
quotes delimiters.  See System.VarICON for more details.
