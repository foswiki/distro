*This guide describes the steps for manually installing Foswiki, with specific steps for installations on Linux with the Apache web server.* If you are using a different web server or operating system, in addition to reviewing this document, check any additional information specific to your platform at Foswiki:Support.SupplementalDocuments.

Getting your Foswiki up and running should take less than 5 minutes to complete. If you are upgrading, please see the [[Foswiki:System.UpgradeGuide][upgrade guide]].

If you need help, feel free to ask a question in the Foswiki:Support web or on Foswiki:Community.InternetRelayChat (irc.freenode.net, channel #foswiki).

---++ Before Installing Foswiki

This guide assumes the person installing Foswiki has a basic knowledge of server administration on the system on which Foswiki is to be installed, as described at Foswiki:System.AdminSkillsAssumptions.

Please see the [[Foswiki:System.SystemRequirements][Foswiki system requirements]] for the server and client requirements to run Foswiki, including the Perl modules required on the server. If you need to install any Perl libraries from CPAN for use by Foswiki, see Foswiki:Support.HowToInstallCpanModules for more information.

---++ 5-Minute Install

Here's the quick version of the instructions, for those that are already comfortable with performing such installations. More detailed instructions follow.

   1. [[Foswiki:Download/][Download]] and unpack the latest version of Foswiki.
   1. Configure Apache using the Foswiki:Support.ApacheConfigGenerator tool to generate a safe, working config file for your Foswiki installation.
   1. Complete the install by browsing to =/bin/configure= in your web browser and follow the instructions.

That's it! You Foswiki should now be installed. Browse to =/bin/view= and start editing!

---++ Detailed Instructions

---+++ Step 1: Download and unpack the Foswiki distribution

*Download* the Foswiki distribution from http://foswiki.org/Download

*Unpack the distribution file:* Change to the directory where you want to place the Foswiki directory. Unzip or untar and gunzip the distribution; a new subdirectory called Foswiki-VERSION will be created. You can rename this subdirectory to a shorter name. For the rest of this document, this subdirectory is assumed to be at =/path/to/foswiki=.
   * *Note:* Foswiki does not support directory paths that contain spaces, so ensure that all of its directory paths do not contain any spaces (particularly on Windows).

If you do not have shell access to your web server host, see the section "[[#UploadingFoswikiDistribution][Uploading the Foswiki distribution to your web server host]]".

---+++ Step 2: Set the file and directory permissions for the installation

_NOTE: You can skip this step if you are on Windows._
<div class="foswikiHelp"> Shouldn't this also talk about changing file
ownership.  =chown -R . www:www=  or =apache:apache= or =wwwdata:wwwdata=
depending upon your distribution?  </div>

The default file and directory access permissions as set by the distribution define a reasonable security level that will work for many types of installations, including shared hosting. Nonetheless, you should verify that the web server user has read access to all files and directories beneath the =foswiki= directory, and execute access for all directories. Also verify that the =data= and =pub= directories and all the subdirectories and files beneath them allow write access for the web server user.

For more information on the appropriate permissions to ensure security for your Foswiki data, see Foswiki:Support.SecuringYourSite.

---+++ Step 3: Configure the locations of the Perl executable and the Foswiki modules

If you are running on a Linux system with Perl found in =/usr/bin/perl= then this step is not required. This step is *required* on Windows installations.

The easiest way to fix up the bin scripts is to run the =tools/rewriteshebang.pl= script.  If the Perl interpreter is in the default execution path, follow these steps:
<div class="foswikiHelp"> I think you can drop the path to the interpreter if perl is on the default path. </div>

<verbatim class="bash">
cd /path/to/foswiki/tools
perl -I ../lib rewriteshebang.pl
</verbatim>

or for Windows users:

<verbatim class="bash">
cd C:\path\to\foswiki\tools
perl -I ..\lib  rewriteshebang.pl
</verbatim>

The script will determine the location of the Perl interpreter and will prompt to update both the bin and tools scripts in a single step.   The changed files will be reported, and it is safe to rerun the script.

If you get an error about perl command not found,  the you need to find where your perl command is installed.  For example: =C:\path\to\perl -I ..\lib rewriteshebang.pl=

---+++ Step 4: Configure the web server

First choose the best configuration method for your web server. With Apache, there are two ways to configure it: a config file included from httpd.conf or .htaccess files.
   * *Apache config file:* The recommended method is using a config file. With a config file you can put the entire Foswiki configuration in ONE file (typically named =foswiki.conf=). Performance is much better with a config file, and one file gives the best overview and ensures that you get a safe installation. However to use a config file you need root or sudo access to stop and start Apache. Most distributions have a directory from which any file that ends with =.conf= gets included when you restart Apache (Example !RedHat/Fedora/Centos: =/etc/httpd/conf.d=, Gentoo: =/etc/apache2/vhost.d= ). Otherwise, you can include the Foswiki apache config file from the main Apache config file.
   * *.htaccess files:* This method should only be used when you cannot use a config file. Performance is slower as Apache must search through _all_ applicable directories for any =.htaccess= files on each page access. Normally this is the only way to control Apache in a shared host environment where you have no root or sudo privileges.

*If you are using a config file*:
   * The easiest and best way is to use the Foswiki:Support.ApacheConfigGenerator tool to generate a safe, working config file for your Foswiki installation, based on the options you choose in the tool.
   * If you can't use the online configuration generator, a sample config file called =foswiki_httpd_conf.txt= can be found in the root of the foswiki installation.
   * Ensure that web access is denied to all Foswiki subdirectories other than =bin= and =pub=.
      * The Foswiki:Support.ApacheConfigGenerator tool will generate the appropriate settings;
      * the =foswiki_httpd_conf.txt= file also has examples of configuring Apache appropriately.
<div class="foswikiHelp">Do we really need this next bullet?  All of the samples already have this set.</div>
   * Ensure there is either a =<noautolink>ScriptAlias<noautolink>= directive for the =bin= subdirectory, or an =Alias= directive with =SetHandler cgi-script= and =Options Exec<nop>CGI= directives for the =bin= subdirectory, so that the =bin= scripts will be executed by Apache.
   * *Note:* you must restart Apache after making changes to your config files for the changes to take effect.

*If you are using a .htaccess file:*
   * In the root of the foswiki installation, there are sample =.htaccess= files for various subdirectories in your installation. Each file has help text explaining how to modify it for your configuration. For more information, see Foswiki:Support.SupplementalDocuments.<sticky>%TABLE{sort="off"}%
   | *location and name of sample .htaccess file* | *copy sample file to the following location* | *tailoring required (Detailed instuctions in each file)* |
   | =foswiki/root-htaccess.txt= | =foswiki/.htaccess= | No |
   | =foswiki/bin-htaccess.txt= | =foswiki/bin/.htaccess= | Yes - Must find/replace all instances of ={DataDir}=, ={DefaultUrlHost}=, ={ScriptUrlPath}= and ={Administrators}= with valid information. |
   | =foswiki/pub-htaccess.txt= | =foswiki/pub/.htaccess= | Yes - Must set correct url path on =ErrorDocument= |
   | =foswiki/subdir-htaccess.txt= | =foswiki/&lt;subdir&gt;/.htaccess= <br />Copy to all other subdirectories below =foswiki=, including =data=, =lib=, =locale=, =templates=, =tools=, =working=.  Copy to any other directories except for =bin= and  =pub= addressed above. | No |</sticky>
   * Ensure that web access is denied to all Foswiki subdirectories other than =bin= and =pub=. The sample =.htaccess= files show how to configure Apache appropriately.  It is important to verify that none of these directories can be directly accessed.
   * Ensure that the =foswiki/bin/.htaccess= files contains the line =SetHandler cgi-script= so that all scripts in the =bin= directory will be executed by Apache.
   * *Note:* On Linux systems, files named with the leading "." like =.htaccess= are hidden files and will not be listed unless using the -a option, ex. =ls -la=

*Turn off any kind of PHP, Perl, Python, Server Side Includes, or other software execution mechanisms supported by your web server in the =pub= directory.* For example, most Linux distributions have a default Apache installation with PHP and server side include (SSI) enabled. This would allow PHP scripts uploaded as attachments to be executed, which is a security risk, so it should be disabled in the Apache configuration with =php_admin_flag engine off=.

Different script execution mechanisms are disabled in different ways; see your web server configuration and documentation for more details.

#ProtectConfigure
---+++  Step 5: Protect the configure script

*You should never leave the =configure= script open to the public.* Limit access to the =bin/configure= script to either localhost, an IP address or a specific user using basic Apache authentication. The Foswiki:Support.ApacheConfigGenerator lets you setup who has access to the =configure= script. Also see the =foswiki-httpd-conf.txt= or =bin-htaccess.txt= file for an example of the setting required to protect the =configure= script.

For more information, refer to Foswiki:Support.ProtectingYourConfiguration.

#ConfigureFoswiki
---+++ Step 6: Configure Foswiki

*Run the [[%SCRIPTURLPATH{"configure"}%][configure]] script* from your browser: enter =http://yourdomain/url/to/foswiki/bin/configure= into your browser address bar.
   * When you access the =configure= web page for the first time, you can only edit the section =General Path Settings=. Make any required changes, and save the settings, whether or not you needed to make any changes. You will be prompted to set a password for the =configure= page: this password must be entered for all subsequent configuration changes, and is also used to log in via the internal admin link (see the section "[[#DefineAdminUser][Define the administrator user(s)]]").
   <blockquote class="foswikiHelp"> %I% *Note:* The =configure= password is remembered by =configure=, separate to web server access controls mentioned in "[[#ProtectConfigure][Protect the configure script]]".</blockquote>
   * After saving the =General Path Settings=, continue configuring Foswiki. Configuration items which may require further attention will be highlighted.
   * If the Foswiki installation can be accessed by more than one !protocol://domain, ensure the additional alternative URLs are set in ={PermittedRedirectHostUrls}=.
   <blockquote class="foswikiHelp"> %T% *Example:* if ={DefaultUrlHost}= is set to =https://wiki.company.com=, an example ={PermittedRedirectHostUrls}= might contain: <verbatim class="html">https://company.com, http://111.222.123.234</verbatim></blockquote>
   * Setup the =Mail and Proxies= section.  Email must be available so Foswiki can send registration emails.
      * Under the "Email General" tab, If you do not want to enable sending registration emails or want to enable it later you can uncheck ={EnableEmail}=. Otherwise the ={WebMasterEmail}= parameter must be configured.
      * Under the "Email Server" tab, you can choose 3 methods of sending email.  This is explained in detail under the help text for this tab.
         * =MailProgram= is typically suitable on most Linux systems, and no further configuration is required.
         * If you chose either of the =Net::SMPT= methods, you must also configure ={SMTP}{MAILHOST}=. Many ISPs have introduced authentication when sending emails to fight spam so you may also have to set ={SMTP}{Username}= and ={SMTP}{Password}=.
         * =Net::SMTP::SSL= will encrypt the connection to the e-mail server and is required for some email services like Google's GMail.
      * Under the "Proxy" tab, if your server is behind a firewall with a proxy, and you wish to install extensions via =configure=, you may have to set ={PROXY}{HOST}= and ={PROXY}{PORT}=.
     <blockquote class="foswikiHelp">%X% %INCLUDE{"UserAuthentication" section="SMTPNOTE"}%</blockquote> <div class="foswikiHelp">I think we can drop this next note - configure will warn if modules are missing</div>
     <blockquote class="foswikiHelp">%X% SMTP authentication requires additional perl modules including =Authen::SASL= and =MIMI::Base64=, </blockquote>

If there is a problem with your setup that prevents you from accessing the =configure= page, you can [[#ConfiguringFoswikiManually][configure Foswiki manually]].

#AuthenticationOfUsers
---+++ Step 7: Authentication

Authentication of users means their activity can be tracked, and access to your site can be controlled. *This is particularly important for sites that are publicly accessible on the web.*  You are strongly encouraged to read [[%SYSTEMWEB%.UserAuthentication]] and Foswiki:Support.UserAuthenticationSupplement for further information about managing users and access controls for your Foswiki site.

The most common authentication methods used for public Foswiki installations are Template Login and Apache Login. They have the following relative advantages:
   * Template Login can be set up without any web server configuration, and users can log off without restarting the browser. As the login page is just a Wiki page, you can customize it to suit your needs.
   * Apache Login allows you to use any Apache-module based authentication scheme, such as =mod_auth_ldap= or =mod_auth_mysql=. However, as your browser is caching your login, you must restart the browser to log out.

Note that the password databases for both of these authentication mechanisms are compatible, so you can switch between them at a later date.

To make it easier to follow the instructions in this section, you can view this installation guide using your Foswiki site by entering =%SYSTEMWEB%.InstallationGuide= into the "Jump" text box. By doing this instead of using the =INSTALL.html= file from the distribution, you will be able to use the embedded hyperlinks to jump directly to the referenced pages.

---++++ Apache Login authentication
%INCLUDE{"UserAuthentication" section="ApacheLogin" INSTALLGUIDE="1"}%

#SearchAlgorithm
---+++ Step 8: Choose an appropriate search algorithm for your Operating System

On the =Store= pane in =configure= you will find the setting ={RCS}{SearchAlgorithm}=.

By default it is set to =Foswiki::Store::SearchAlgorithms::Forking= which is what you should keep if you install Foswiki in Linux or any other Unix type operating system.

If you install Foswiki on a Windows server, using an external grep program can create problems because of limitations in the length of command lines. You may be able to run with Forking in Windows if your directory path to Foswiki is kept short (short directory names and few levels), however the recommended (safe) setting for Windows is =Foswiki::Store::SearchAlgorithms::PurePerl=.

#DefineAdminUser
---+++ Step 9: Define the administrator user(s)

---++++ About Administrators

Administrators have read and write access to any topic, regardless of any access controls that have been applied to the topic or its web. The _special user_ [[%USERSWEB%.AdminUser]] is accessed by logging in with user =admin= and the password established when initially saving the configuration. *Don't log in with the wikiname* ==AdminUser==.

After installing Foswiki, you can also register other users that you will use to administer Foswiki. To make a user an administrator, add the WikiName for the user to the =AdminGroup=, defined in the =[[%USERSWEB%.AdminGroup]]= topic in your Foswiki installation.

Note that with the _sudo_ or internal admin login, it is not necessary to add other users to the AdminGroup.  However if you have more than one administrator, you may still want to do this to ensure that topic changes are attributed to a specific user instead of the default %USERSWEB%.AdminUser.

By adding users to %USERSWEB%.AdminGroup:
   * Users with Admin rights will have routine access to topics that might normally be denied.
   * These users will be unable to test or demonstrate access controls.
   * Changes made are always attributed to a unique logged in user.
   * Password sharing of the =bin/configure= password is not required

By using the _internal admin login_:
   * You don't need to grant admin rights to individual users
   * All users will be subject to access controls.
   * Changes made while using the _internal admin login_ are attributed to %USERSWEB%.AdminUser
   * The "save" password for =bin/configure= will need to be shared among administrators

---++++ Adding users to the %USERSWEB%.AdminGroup

To add an initial administrator to the =AdminGroup=, perform the following steps:

   * If you are not already logged in with your WikiName, then login.
   * Go to the =[[%USERSWEB%.AdminGroup]]= topic and select the "internal admin login" link. Login using the password you set on the =configure= page.
   * After you have logged in as the internal admin, view the =%USERSWEB%.AdminGroup= topic. Follow the instructions on the page to add users to the %USERSWEB%.AdminGroup. You do _not_ need to edit the topic.

Any member of the %USERSWEB%.AdminGroup can add subsequent members &mdash; you do not have to use the internal admin login.

To more easily debug access control issues, you may want to have a regular Foswiki user account for daily use, and a special one that belongs to the =AdminGroup= that you use only for administering your Foswiki site. See [[%SYSTEMWEB%.AccessControls]] for more information on access controls and user groups.

---+++ Congratulations!

You now have set up your Foswiki installation! At this point you can start creating and editing pages. See InstallationGuidePart2 to proceed with further tailoring your site.

In order to keep your user, group, and site configuration information separate from the actual content of your site, it is recommended that you create a new web in which your site's pages will reside. See [[%SYSTEMWEB%.ManagingWebs]] for more information on Wiki webs and how to create one.

#TroubleshootingInstall
---++ Troubleshooting

If you are having problems with your installation, try the following:

   * Run the =configure= script and ensure you have resolved all errors and are satisfied that you understand any warnings.
   * Consult the topics at Foswiki:Support.SupplementalDocuments and Foswiki:Support.AskedQuestions.
   * Ask for help on [[Foswiki:Community.InternetRelayChat][IRC]] (irc.freenode.net, channel #foswiki). There are often a number of people waiting to help.
   * Ask a question in the Foswiki:Support web

#UploadingFoswikiDistribution
---++ Uploading the Foswiki distribution to your web server host

If you cannot unpack the Foswiki distribution directly in your installation directory, you can unpack the distribution on your local computer, manually create the directory structure on your host server and upload the files as follows:
   * Using the table below, create a directory structure on your host server
   * Upload the Foswiki files by FTP (transfer as text except for the image files in =pub= directory.)
   * *Note:* Don't worry if you are not able to put the =lib= directory at the same level as the =bin= directory. You can create this directory elsewhere and configure the =bin/setlib.cfg= file.<sticky>
   | *Foswiki dir:* | *What it is:* | *Where to copy:* | *Example:* |
   | =foswiki= | start-up pages | root Foswiki dir | =/home/smith/public_html/foswiki/= |
   | =foswiki/bin= | CGI bin | CGI-enabled dir | =/home/smith/public_html/foswiki/bin= |
   | =foswiki/lib= | library files | same level as =bin= | =/home/smith/public_html/foswiki/lib= |
   | =foswiki/locale= | language files | dir secure from public access | =/home/smith/public_html/foswiki/locale= |
   | =foswiki/pub= | public files | htdoc enabled dir | =/home/smith/public_html/foswiki/pub= |
   | =foswiki/data= | topic data | dir secure from public access | =/home/smith/public_html/foswiki/data= |
   | =foswiki/templates= | web templates | dir secure from public access | =/home/smith/public_html/foswiki/templates= |
   | =foswiki/tools= | Foswiki utlilities | dir secure from public access | =/home/smith/public_html/foswiki/tools= |
   | =foswiki/working= | Temporary and internal files | dir secure from public access | =/home/smith/public_html/foswiki/working= |</sticky>


---++ TWiki Compatibility

Foswiki is 100% backwards compatible with TWiki<sup>&reg;</sup> markup up to and including TWiki 4.2.4. Existing TWiki webs, topics and attachments can be used with Foswiki without requiring any changes.

To support a seamless upgrade from TWiki, Foswiki ships with a plugin called =TWikiCompatibilityPlugin=. This plugin enables most TWiki extensions to work with Foswiki, without modifications. It also maps requests for legacy TWiki web topics to their Foswiki equivalents, as defined in Foswiki:Development.TopicNameMappingTable. The =TWIKIWEB= and =MAINWEB= TWiki variables are also mapped to the new Foswiki macros =SYSTEMWEB= and =USERSWEB=.

If you are not upgrading an existing TWiki installation and do not plan to install plugins from the TWiki web site, it is recommended that you disable the !TWikiCompatibilityPlugin in the _Plugins_ Section on the =configure= page.

If a plugin exists both in a TWiki version and a Foswiki version, it is strongly recommended that you use the Foswiki version, as this is coded to work optimally with Foswiki. As part of the Foswiki project, the Foswiki community is evaluating all of the extensions that are available for TWiki, and porting them over to the Foswiki name space. Many of them are being enhanced through the removal of bugs and security vulnerabilities, resulting in better, more functional extensions for Foswiki.
