# OPTIONAL
# If you need to use perl modules that are not installed in the standard
# directories (e.g. you have downloaded extra modules for use with plugins)
# then you can add the absolute paths to those modules below. You can list
# as many directories as you want, each directory within quotes, and 
# directories separated by commas.

# http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2002/04/10/mod_perl.html?page=3 has good advice
# on installing CPAN modules without superuser privileges.
