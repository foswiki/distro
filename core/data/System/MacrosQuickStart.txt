---++ Macros Quickstart

%STARTINCLUDE%

Macros are names enclosed in percent signs that are that are expanded to some other text when the topic is displayed. For example, =%<nop>TOPIC%= is expanded to %TOPIC%, the title of this topic.

Some macros can take arguments in curly braces - for example, =%<nop>INCLUDE{"OtherTopic" ARG="arg"}%=.

Many macro definitions are built-in, and others ([[%SYSTEMWEB%.PreferenceSettings][preference settings]]) are predefined for your convenience. You can also define your own
[[%SYSTEMWEB%.PreferenceSettings][preference settings]] at the entire site, individual web, or individual topic level. For more information, see *[[Macros]]*

Macros are fully expanded _before_ any of the text formatting rules are applied.

*Documentation Graphics:* There are many graphics available to use in your topics. Use =%<nop>ICON{"help"}%=, =%<nop>ICON{"tip"}%=, and =%<nop>ICON{"warning"}%= to get: %H%, %T%, and %X%, respectively. DocumentGraphics lists them all.

%ICON{"tip"}% To "escape" a macro, prefix it with an exclamation mark. Write: =!%<nop>SOMEMACRO%= to get: !%SOMEMACRO%.
