#VarINCLUDINGWEB
---+++ INCLUDINGWEB -- web that includes current topic
   * The web name of the topic that includes the current topic - same as =%<nop>WEB%= if there is no =INCLUDE=.
   * If a topic is used in a chain of =INCLUDEs=, =INCLUDINGWEB= is set to the topic directly INCLUDing this one, _NOT_ the web that has been requested by the user (which is set in =BASEWEB=)
   <blockquote class="foswikiHelp">%X% While this Macro may appear to work, unless you require the subtle difference between =INCLUDINGWEB= and =BASEWEB=, you probably should use =BASEWEB= </blockquote>
   * Syntax: =%<nop>INCLUDINGWEB%=
