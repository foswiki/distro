# Example build class. Copy this file to the equivalent place in your
# plugin or contrib and edit.
#
# Read the comments at the top of lib/Foswiki/Contrib/Build.pm for
# details of how the build process works, and what files you
# have to provide and where.
#
# Requires the environment variable FOSWIKI_LIBS (a colon-separated path
# list) to be set to point at the build system and any required dependencies.
# Usage: ./build.pl [-n] [-v] [target]
# where [target] is the optional build target (build, test,
# install, release, uninstall), test is the default.
# Two command-line options are supported:
# -n Don't actually do anything, just print commands
# -v Be verbose
#

# Standard preamble
use strict;
use warnings;

BEGIN { unshift @INC, split( /:/, $ENV{FOSWIKI_LIBS} ); }

use Foswiki::Contrib::Build;

# Create the build object
my $build = new Foswiki::Contrib::Build('PlainFileStoreContrib');

# Build the target on the command line, or the default target
$build->build( $build->{target} );
