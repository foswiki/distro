---+ Foswiki Upgrade Guide

<!-- Document writers. Please note that this document is distributed in HTML version in the root of the distribution. You cannot use WikiWord links or any other local linking. -->

_This guide covers upgrading from a previous version of Foswiki or TWiki (such as Cairo or TWiki4.0) to Foswiki 1.0_

%TOC%

---++ Overview

Foswiki is a fork from TWiki 4.2.3. Upgrades from all TWiki versions and earlier Foswiki versions is supported. It is designed to be 100% compatible with the content of TWiki sites, using the same markup language and supporting the same plugin API (through the use of a =TWikiCompatibilityPlugin=), thereby enabling a smooth transition from TWiki to Foswiki.

---+++ Upgrade Requirements

   * Please review the Foswiki:System.AdminSkillsAssumptions before you upgrade your site.
   * To upgrade from an old TWiki Release to the latest Foswiki production release, follow the instructions below.
   * Before upgrading, you may wish to make a backup of your topics.
   * Once the upgrade has been applied, an existing earlier installation will still be able to read all the topics, but should not be used to write.
   * Some TWiki plugins are not compatible with Foswiki (usually ones that use a private API or execute helper scripts); you may need to migrate to the equivalent extension in the Foswiki:Extensions repository.

---+++ Upgrading from TWiki to Foswiki

You are strongly advised to read the Foswiki:System.ReleaseNotes01x00 (also available in an HTML file in the root of your installation), which contains a list of changes from TWiki 4.2.3 to Foswiki 1.0. A number of system topics and macros (formerly known as TWiki variables) have been renamed, to better describe their purpose and, where appropriate, to rebrand to the Foswiki name.


---++ Upgrade Procedure

The following is a high level view of the upgrade procedure:

   1 Install the new Foswiki version and configure it with the same settings as the old version.
   1 Install any additional extensions (Plugins) used by your old Foswiki installation. Make sure to use the latest Foswiki versions.
   1 Copy all the non-default webs from the old installation to the new one.
   1 Copy the users from old installation to the new one, including all the user topics from the =%<nop>USERSWEB%= web (Foswiki sites) or Main web (TWiki sites).
   1 Apply your site customizations to your skin (logos, menu bars, and so forth).
   1 Apply preferences from the old installation.

More details for each step appear in the following sections. The steps may need to be modified or otherwise tailored with specifics for your installation. In particular, you may need to take care to preserve any special configuration or customizations you have made, especially if you have modified any of the distributed software files or system topics.
   
---+++ Installation

   * *Follow the installation instructions in INSTALL.html* which you find in the root of the new installation. *Install the new release in a new directory.* Do not install on top of the old release.
      * For purposes of discussion, assume the old installation is installed under the =wiki= subdirectory, and the new installation is installed under the =newwiki= directory.
      * For public or otherwise sensitive installations, ensure that your web server configuration is set to deny access to the new Foswiki installation to anyone except you.
   * *Use the =configure= script* to configure Foswiki.
      * *If you are upgrading from an older Foswiki release*, copy your old =wiki/lib/LocalSite.cfg= file to =newwiki/lib/LocalSite.cfg=&nbsp;. Alternatively, you can reconfigure the new installation from scratch (you can use at your old =LocalSite.cfg= file as a reference).
      * *If you are upgrading from a TWiki site*, you must reconfigure your Foswiki installation from scratch. You cannot copy over your old =LocalSite.cfg= file (though you can use it as a reference).
      * Run =configure= and set the configuration values in the new installation to match those of the old installation. Save the configuration after you have completed your changes.
      * To wipe out all your settings and start configuring from a fresh installation, just delete the =newwiki/lib/LocalSite.cfg= file and run =configure=.
   * Additional resources   
      * Foswiki:Support.UpgradingFromOlderTWikiReleases - upgrading TWiki from older TWiki releases
      * Foswiki:Support.UpgradingFromTWiki4x2Releases - upgrading from TWiki4.2.X to Foswiki
      * Foswiki:Support.UpgradingPatchReleases - upgrading releases where only last digit in the version changed 
      * Foswiki:Support.InstallationGuide
      * Foswiki:Support.InstallingOnSpecificPlatforms
      * Foswiki:Support.ApacheConfigGenerator
      * Foswiki:Support.SettingFileAccessRightsLinuxUnix

Test your newly-installed Foswiki site and ensure that its basic functionality works: viewing and editing topics (you can try creating and editing a topic in the Sandbox web).

To make it easier to follow the subsequent steps, you can view this upgrade guide using your new Foswiki site by entering =%SYSTEMWEB%.UpgradeGuide= into the "Jump" text box on the top right of any topic. By doing this instead of using the UpgradeGuide.html file from the distribution, you will be able to use the embedded hyperlinks to jump directly to the referenced pages.

---+++ Install Extensions

Install all of the extensions that were installed in your old site. In particular, start with any extensions required for the authentication and authorization methods you use (if any). You can use the _Find more extensions_ button in the _Extensions_ section of the =configure= page to install and confgiure extensions from the Foswiki:Extensions repository. You can also install extensions manually; see the instructions on the extension's web page from where you obtained the extension (for Foswiki extensions, on foswiki.org).

   * *Note:* some TWiki extensions may not work with Foswiki. By default, the =TWikiCompatibilityPlugin= is installed to provide backwards compatible support for TWiki plugins. However if the TWiki plugin calls private APIs or invokes helper scripts, it may still not work correctly. Check for an upgraded Foswiki version of the extension in the Foswiki:Extensions repository and install it instead.

Check the plugin topics from your old TWiki/Foswiki installation and transfer the plugin settings to the =[[%LOCALSITEPREFS%]]= topic in your new Foswiki site, prefixing each setting with the name of the plugin in uppercase followed by an underscore. For example, to copy over the =DEFAULT_TYPE= setting from the =CommentPlugin= topic in the old site to the new site, copy the value to a =COMMENTPLUGIN_DEFAULT_TYPE= setting in the =[[%LOCALSITEPREFS%]]= topic in the new site.

Some typical plugin settings you may have altered.
   * =CommentPlugin= - Set DEFAULT_TYPE
   * =EditTablePlugin= - Set CHANGEROWS, Set QUIETSAVE, and Set EDITBUTTON
   * =InterwikiPlugin= - Set RULESTOPIC
   * =InterWikis= - If you added your own rules you should save this topic and not overwrite it.
   * =SlideShowPlugin= - If you changed the embedded 'Default Slide Template', then save the contents of this topic and do not overwrite it. (You should prefer creating your own slide show template in a separate topic, so you will not have to take special steps over upgrades to preserve your modifications to the default slide template.)
   * =SmiliesPlugin= - Did you add your own smileys? No real changes were made to the smilies topic October 2005 so you can just leave this topic as it is.
   * =TablePlugin= - Set TABLEATTRIBUTES   

Activate, and if required, configure the installed extensions in =configure=.

---+++ Copy your old webs to new Foswiki

   * When upgrading from TWiki Cairo or earlier it may be necessary to unlock the rcs files in data and pub directories from the old installation using the following shell commands:
      * =find data -name '*,v' -exec rcs -u -M '{}' \;=
      * =find pub -name '*,v' -exec rcs -u -M '{}' \;=
   * Copy your local webs over to the data and pub directories of the new install. Do not copy the default webs: System (or TWiki), Main, Trash, Sandbox, _default, and _empty.
   * Make sure all data and pub files and directories are owned by the webserver user.
   * *Note:* Foswiki's =WebChanges= topics depend on the file timestamp. If you touch the .txt files make sure to preserve the timestamp, or to change them in the sequence of old file timestamps.

---+++ Copy Users And Their Topics From Main Web

   * Copy all the topics from the Main web and corresponding pub/Main directories from the old TWiki/Foswiki to the new Foswiki but do not overwrite any of the new topics already inside the new Main directory!
   * Manually merge all the users from the old =Main.WikiUsers= topic to the new Foswiki. Foswiki does not ship with a =Main.WikiUsers= topic. When you register the first user Foswiki now checks for an existing =Main.WikiUsers= and if it does not exist it gets created.
      * For upgrades from TWiki to Foswiki the =TWikiUsers= topic must additionally be renamed to =WikiUsers=. If you upgrade from Cairo you can simply use the old file renamed to =WikiUsers= and add the missing new system users to the list of users. If you upgrade from TWiki-4.0.X simply use the old topic renamed to =WikiUsers=.
   * For upgrades from TWiki to Foswiki also copy the =Main.TWikiAdminGroup= topic so that topics you have protected with ALLOWTOPICCHANGE or ALLOWWEBCHANGE set to !TWikiAdminGroup are still protected. Otherwise people can create the =TWikiAdminGroup= and put themselves in it. 
   * If you use =data/.htpasswd= for authentication copy this file from the old TWiki/Foswiki to the new Foswiki.
      * If you upgrade from Cairo and you are using the Htpasswd login manager, then note that email addresses for users have moved out of user topics and into the password file. There is a script that performs this extra upgrade step for you - see =tools/upgrade_emails.pl=.
   * The old sandbox web may have a lot of useful topic and users may use it actively for drafts. Manually select the topics (remember the corresponding pub directories) from the old Sandbox web and copy them to the new Foswiki. Decide if you want to overwrite the sandbox homepage and left menu bar or keep the new.
   * If you added or removed fields from the user topic form you may also have tailored =%SYSTEMWEB%.UserRegistration=. Make sure you either reuse the registration topic from the old installation or apply the same field changes to the new =%SYSTEMWEB%.UserRegistration= topic.
      * Upgraders from TWiki must note that =TWikiRegistration= was renamed to =UserRegistration= in Foswiki.
   * Foswiki ships with =NewUserTemplate= and =UserForm= in the System web. If you choose to tailor anything you are strongly adviced to copy =NewUserTemplate= and =UserForm= to the Main web and tailor the Main web copies. Foswiki will look for the =NewUserTemplate= in the Main web first and if it does not exist it uses the default from the System web. By creating a =Main.NewUserTemplate= and its =Main.UserForm= you will not loose your tailorings next time you upgrade Foswiki.
   * Make sure all data and pub files and directories are owned by the webserver user.

---+++ Apply Customizations To The Skin

   * Not many of the old TWiki Cairo skins work well with Foswiki
   * Add Logos, update top bar and left bar as required.
   * Apply any desired changes to style sheets and templates. The default !PatternSkin has been totally rewritten since Cairo and once more in 4.0.2. Since then changes to !PatternSkin have been minor and you may be able to carry over most simpler tailorings directly from 4.0.2-4.0.5.
   * Additional resources:
      * =%SYSTEMWEB%.PatternSkinCustomization=
      * =%SYSTEMWEB%.PatternSkinCssCookbook=
   * From Foswiki 1.0.0 the =WebLeftBar= topic is no longer shipped with the distribution. Foswiki 1.0.0 !PatternSkin will use the topic =WebLeftBarExample= if there is no =WebLeftBar= topic in the current web. To make your own =WebLeftBar= simply make it a copy of =WebLeftBarExample= and change it as you desire. Next time you upgrade you can be safe that your =WebLeftBar= topic is not being overwritten by the upgrade.
   
---+++ Apply Preferences From Old Installation

   * Transfer any customized and local settings from =%SYSTEMWEB%.DefaultPreferences= to the topic pointed at by {LocalSitePreferences}. Per default this is =%USERSWEB%.SitePreferences=. This avoids having to write over files in the distribution on a later upgrade.
      * Upgraders from TWiki should note that the =Main.TWikiPreferences= is renamed to =SitePreferences=, and =TWiki.TWikiPreferences= is renamed to =System.DefaultPreferences= in Foswiki.
   * If you changed any of the topics in the original TWiki/Foswiki distribution, you will have to transfer your changes to the new install manually. 
   * Compare the =WebPreferences= topics in the old TWiki/Foswiki Installation with the default from the new Foswiki installation and add any new Preferences that may be relevant.

---++ Customization of Special Pages

Some pages in the Foswiki web are meant to be customized after choice of authentication. If you do not use the internal Foswiki password manager the topics that contains the features for changing and resetting passwords and changing the email address should be changed to a note describing how to perform these tasks in your organization. If you have made such customizations remember to replace these topics in the System web with the tailored versions from your old installation. If you upgrade from TWiki remember that the old TWiki web is called System web in Foswiki. The topics are:

   * =System.ChangePassword=
   * =System.ResetPassword=
   * =System.ChangeEmailAddress=

---++ Upgrading from TWiki Cairo to Foswiki (additional advice)

---+++ Favicon

Foswiki's !PatternSkin use the favicon feature which most browsers use to show a small icon in front of the URL and for bookmarks.

By default the same favicon is used in all webs and stored in %<nop>PUBURLPATH%/%<nop>SYSTEMWEB%/ProjectLogos/favicon.ico 

You can replace this globally by attaching a favicon to any topic and point to it with a setting in !%USERSWEB%.SitePreferences

You can also have a unique favicon for each web by applying similar setting in !WebPreferences in each web.

The setting you need must look similar to this

<verbatim>
   * Set FAVICON = %PUBURLPATH%/webname/topicname/favicon.ico
</verbatim>

---+++ !WikiUsers topic in Main web

As part of the rebranding from TWiki to Foswiki, the !TWikiUsers topic was renamed to !WikiUsers but the format is the exact same.

Your Cairo !TWikiUsers topic will work in Foswiki but you will need to ensure that these 4 users from the default Foswiki version of !WikiUsers are copied to the existing !WikiUsers topic. !WikiGuest is probably already there but the others are new
   * *ProjectContributor* - placeholder for a Foswiki developer, and is used in Foswiki documentation
   * *WikiGuest* - guest user, used as a fallback if the user can't be identified
   * *RegistrationAgent* - special user used during the new user registration process
   * *UnknownUser* - used where the author of a previously stored piece of data can't be determined


---++ Important Changes since TWiki 4.0.5

---+++ Supported Perl version

TWiki 4.0.5 worked on Perl version 5.6.X. Reports from users has shown that unfortunately Foswiki does not support Perl versions older then 5.8.0. It is especially the Wysiwyg editor and support for international character sets that requires new features in Perl 5.8.X.

---+++ Template spec changed

Until TWiki 4.0.5 !SkinTemplates (formerly !TWikiTemplates) the text inside template definition blocks (anything between %<nop>TMPL:DEF{"block"}% and %<nop>TMPL:END% was stripped of leading and trailing white space incl new lines.

This caused a lot of problems for skin developers when you wanted a newline before or after the block text.

From TWiki 4.1.0 and continuing in Foswiki this has changed so that white space is no longer stripped. Skins like !PatternSkin and !NatSkin have been updated so that they work with the new behavior. But if you use an older skin or have written your own you will most likely need to make some adjustments.

It is not difficult. The general rule is - if you get mysterious blank lines in your skin, the newline after the %<nop>TMPL:DEF{"block"}% needs to be removed. Ie. the content of the block must follow on the same line as the TMPL:DEF.

The spec change have the same impact on !CommentPlugin templates where you may have to remove the first line break after the TMPL:DEF. See the =%SYSTEMWEB%.CommentPluginTemplate= for examples of how comment template definitions should look like in TWiki-4.1.X

An example: A !CommentPlugin template that adds a comment as appending a row to a table. Before the spec change this would work.

<verbatim>
<verbatim>
%TMPL:DEF{OUTPUT:tabletest}%%POS:BEFORE%
|%URLPARAM{"comment"}%| -- %WIKIUSERNAME% - %DATE% |
%TMPL:END%
</verbatim>
</verbatim>

From Twiki 4.1.0 the old template definition will add an empty line before the new table row. To fix it simply remove the new line before the table.

<verbatim>
<verbatim>
%TMPL:DEF{OUTPUT:tabletest}%%POS:BEFORE%|%URLPARAM{"comment"}%| -- %WIKIUSERNAME% - %DATE% |
%TMPL:END%
</verbatim>
</verbatim>

The advantage of the spec change is that now you can add leading and trailing white space including new lines. This was not possible before.

---++ Important Changes since TWiki 4.1.0

---+++ New location for session and other temporary files

The directory for passthrough files and session files have been replaced by a common directory for temporary files used by Foswiki. Previously the two configure settings ={PassthroughDir}= and ={Sessions}{Dir}= were by default set to =/tmp=. These config settings have been eliminated. Foswiki creates the tmp directory and other temporary directors under the directory defined by the configure setting ={WorkingDir}=

---++ Important Changes since TWiki 4.1.2

---+++ New WYSIWYG Editor

Foswiki now ships with a new WYSIWYG editor based on !TinyMCE replaces the Kupu based editor.%BR% !TinyMCE is not a perfect Wysiwyg editor but it is magnitudes better than the Kupu editor

The !WysiwygPlugin that drives the engine behind both !TinyMCE has additionally been heavily improved so that less Foswiki Applications are negatively affected by editing WYSIWYG

When !TinyMCEPlugin is enabled the Edit button per default becomes WYSIWYG editing mode. A new Raw Edit link has been added to enable application developers to edit the good old way

The WYSIWYG button has been removed.

---+++ NEWTOPICLINKSYMBOL removed

The NEWTOPICLINKSYMBOL preference which was deprecated in TWiki 4.1 has now been removed from the code. If you want to control the appearance of new links, you can use NEWLINKFORMAT.

---+++ !UserForm and !NewUserTemplate Customization

When a new user registers on Foswiki his user topic is created based on the =NewUserTemplate= and =UserForm=.

The =NewUserTemplate= was located in the TWiki web and the =UserForm= in the Main web. When you earlier upgraded TWiki these were some of the topics you had to take care not to overwrite.

In Foswiki the =UserForm= and =NewUserTemplate= are distributed in the System web. If you create the two in the Main web the Main web version will be used instead. So if you tailor the user topic format or the form then you should always copy the two files to the Main web and modify the ones in the Main web. When you later upgrade Foswiki your tailored template and form will not be overwritten.

---+++ !WikiUsers no longer distributed

The =Main.WikiUsers= topic contains all the registered users. It is a topic you do not want to overwrite when you upgrade Foswiki.

This file is not included in the Foswiki distribution. When you register the first time Foswiki creates the =Main.WikiUsers= topic in the Main web if it does not exist already. This means that you can now upgrade Foswiki without risk of overwriting the important =WikiUsers= topic.

   * For new installers this makes no difference at all
   * For upgraders this is one less problem to worry about as your important !Main.WikiUsers topic now no longer gets overwritten when upgrading.
   
---+++ New =working= directory

A new directory =working= which per default is located in the twiki root, has been introduced which contains:

   * registration_approvals - with 4.2.0 it is moved to here from the data directory)
   * tmp - so we now avoid having to fight with special access rights and /tmp directory that gets cleaned out when booting.
   * work_areas - with 4.2.0 it is moved to here from the pub directory. Configure automatically moved the directory when you upgrade.

Note: Remember to restrict access to this new directory when you upgrade.

The configuration setting ={WorkingDir}= defines the container directory for temporary files, extensions' work areas, and intermediate registration data.  The default is =working= under your installation root.

Take care for that change if you run your own routine to delete obsolete session files, which will now be found under =working/tmp/cgisess*=.
   
---+++ New Internal Admin Login

Foswiki has a new _Internal Admin Login_ feature which uses "admin" (configurable) as username and the password used for configure to become temporary administrator. When you do a new installation you need to use this feature as !Main.AdminGroup is now access restricted by default to avoid security attacks during the hours an installation may take. From configure there is a link to the !AdminGroup topic and on !AdminGroup the step by step instructions are written in a yellow box. Our advice is not to remove this help text in case you need it later.
