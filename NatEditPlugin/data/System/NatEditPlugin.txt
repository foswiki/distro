---++ Description
%STARTSECTION{"summary"}%
The <nop>NatEdit is an wiki editor that helps in learning the TML
Language by providing a GUI. By design, this is not a wysiwyg editor that tries
to generate the correct TML in the background. Instead, the user is still in
charge of writing correct wiki markup but with a bit more of assistance as a
plain browser textarea. Therefor this editor helps to lower the learning curve
but will not get in your way once you are aware of wiki markup. 
%ENDSECTION{"summary"}%

<nop>NatEdit is implemented as a jquery plugin, called =jquery.natedit=,
and thus heavily depends on javascript. Hence browsers without javascript are not supported. 
You will need to install the <nop>JQueryPlugin to use <nop>NatEdit.

Caution:
Unlikely previous versions (pre 2.0), 
theming has been disabled in the current version. So you are "stuck" with one and the
same button layout for now.
