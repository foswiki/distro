Welcome to <nop>%WIKITOOLNAME%! This site is a meeting place to work on common interests. Anyone can contribute using any web browser. <nop>%WIKITOOLNAME% looks like a normal web site... except that it encourages contribution and *editing* of pages, questions, answers, comments and updates.

"Wiki" systems are fundamentally editable web pages. It's a fun and useful way of communicating asynchronously over the web for many existing intranet and public internet sites.  %WIKITOOLNAME% is simple to learn and use.  It aims to provide a transparent way for you to publish and exchange your ideas with others over the web. You will find more about wikis in general at WikiCulture.

---++ So what is it that you can do?

   * *Browse.* This is a site like other sites. Read and follow interesting links.
   * *Write.* Speak your mind! From your browser you can change or add to anything you see in a %WIKITOOLNAME% topic. Use regular text or [[TopicMarkupLanguage][wiki syntax]].
   * *Try.* Do not worry that anything could go wrong. When you change a topic, its previous versions are saved and can be recovered.
   * *Start to figure it out.* Some good places to start:
      * BeginnersStartHere is a short introduction training course for beginners. 
      * TwentyMinuteTutorial is a 20-minute tour of %WIKITOOLNAME% essentials. 
      * WikiCulture gives the 3,000 metre view popular with senior management.
