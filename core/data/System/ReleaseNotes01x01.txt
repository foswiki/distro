---+!! Foswiki Release 1.1.1 - 25 Oct 2010

%TOC%

---++ Foswiki - The Free and Open Source Wiki

Foswiki is an enterprise collaboration and information sharing tool targeted for professional use in many types of organizations: from small businesses to multi-nationals, from one-product open source groups, to worldwide research networks.

Foswiki is a wiki: fundamentally, a website with editable web pages. It looks like a normal web site but it encourages contributions, edits, updates, questions, and answers from its users. It's a powerful way of enabling a community to communicate asynchronously using intranet and public internet websites. Foswiki is simple to learn and use. It aims to provide a transparent way for you to publish and exchange your ideas with others over the web and eliminates the one-webmaster syndrome of outdated intranet content.

Foswiki is a structured wiki with tools that enable users without programming skills to build powerful yet simple applications to process information and support workflows. Developers can extend the functionality of Foswiki with plugins.

Foswiki is the old TWiki project under a new name. Restrictions on the use of the TWiki brand resulted in many of its developers continuing the project under the new Foswiki name. Foswiki is backwards compatible with all content from older TWiki installations. Foswiki 1.1 ships with a !TWikiCompatibilityPlugin, thus enabling most extensions made for TWiki to work under Foswiki. Since the start of the Foswiki project there have been several releases of TWiki, However there have been very few functionality changes, and the useful changes have all been tracked in Foswiki, so topics and wiki applications supported by TWiki should also work with Foswiki.

Foswiki is released under the GNU General Public License.

#Release01x01Changes
---++ Important changes since Foswiki 1.1.3

---+++ [[Foswikitask:Item10874][Item10874]]: 1.1.3 may have changed some =form.name= MetaData to contain fully-qualified (with web name prefix) values
In Foswiki 1.1.4 this problem has been fixed, however, users upgrading from 1.1.3 may wish to review the following information to determine if they need to take action on their existing SEARCHes or !DataForm topics.
<blockquote class="foswikiHelp">%I% Please note, you may be unaffected by Foswikitask:Item10874 if:
   * You have never used Foswiki 1.1.3
   * You are not [[%SYSTEMWEB%.QuerySearch][QuerySearching]] =form.name= MetaData for exact topic-only (without web prefix) values, or
   * Your users are not adding or changing DataForms on their topics via the edit screen's "add/change form" button, or
   * Your installation is using Foswiki:Extensions.NatEditPlugin </blockquote>

---++++ Description
Any topics which have had a [[System.DataForms][DataForm]] added or changed using the "Add/change form" button on the edit screen while running Foswiki 1.1.3 will now have "fully-qualified" Web.Topic names in the =form.name= System.MetaData even if the =WEBFORMS= preference variable omitted web prefixes from [[%SYSTEMWEB%.DataForms][DataForm]] topic names. In other words, if you were using a =WEBFORMS= preference which looked like this:%JQREQUIRE{"chili"}%
<verbatim class="tml">   * Set WEBFORMS = MyForm</verbatim>

In Foswiki 1.1.3, the "Add/change form" button on the edit screen actually treats it like this:
<verbatim class="tml">   * Set WEBFORMS = TheWeb/TheSubWeb.MyForm</verbatim>

Having selected "MyForm", the =form.name= value is actually stored as =TheWeb/SomeSubWeb.MyForm=. This prevents System.QuerySearch type [[System.VarSEARCH][SEARCHes]] for an exact match on the topic-only value of =form.name= from working correctly, for example:
<verbatim class="tml">%SEARCH{"form.name='MyForm'" type="query" ...}%</verbatim>

... will not match these topics. Instead, a search on both possible values can be used:
<verbatim class="tml">%SEARCH{"form.name='MyForm' OR form.name='TheWeb/SomeSubWeb.MyForm'" type="query" ...}%</verbatim>

Or a regex query:
<verbatim class="tml">%SEARCH{"form.name=~'\bMyForm$'" type="query" ...}%</verbatim></blockquote>

Alternatively, the erroneous =form.name= values can be repaired by searching for and fixing them using one of the solutions detailed in Foswikitask:Item10874#Solution

---+++ [[Foswikitask:Item10905][Item10905]]: Unable to include spaces in the query string of mailto links
An old legacy link format deprecated in 2005 was interfering with the ability to pass complex query params to explicit http: and mailto: links.  This issue is fixed, but there is a loss of some backwards compatbility. Before this fix, this link:  =[<nop>[mailto:user@example.com?subject=some email]]= woud generate a message with the subject = "some" and link text of "email".  After the fix,  the link text will be the entire email address and the subject will be "some email".
If the original link text is required, it should be entered as =[<nop>[mailto:user@example.com?subject=some][email]]=

Note that this fix also adds a new configuration parameter: =$Foswiki::cfg{AntiSpam}{EntityEncode}=.  Entity encoding of email addresses as an anti-spam technique was previously controlled by the parameter =$Foswiki::cfg{AntiSpam}{HideUserDetails}=.  Both parameters default to enabled.  If you disabled the =$Foswiki::cfg{AntiSpam}{HideUserDetails}= option and desire the same behavior, you should also disable. =$Foswiki::cfg{AntiSpam}{EntityEncode}=.  This fix corrects an issue where mailto links were double-encoded, breaking the ability to include more than one option in the query string.

---+++ Email enhancements

Significant enhancements were made to the Foswiki email implementation.  These changes increase our compatibility with email services like Google's gmail, add enterprise features like S/MIME signed mail, and add a test facility to
help the administrator better diagnose email problems before testing registration.

   * [[Foswikitask:Item10521][Item10521]]: Implement SSL support, which adds direct support for gmail.
   * [[Foswikitask:Item10522][Item10522]]: Implement S/MIME support for signed email using either =sendmail= or the =Net::SMTP= methods. 
   * [[Foswikitask:Item10523][Item10523]]: Add configure parameter to select GMT or Servertime in generated email messages
   * [[Foswikitask:Item10919][Item10919]]: Implement an Email test function in configure.

These changes are backwards compatible with =LocalSite.cfg= however it is recommended to visit the Email tab in configure, correct any warnings, and save the configuration parameters guessed when the configuration is migrated.

Note that there are some subtle changes to the Email implementation. Prior to these changes, Foswiki guessed the email send method based upon the setting of the mail server name, which can be configured in =LocalSite.cfg=, as well as a
deprecated preference setting =SMTPMAILHOST=.  Once the configuration is updated for 1.1.4, the Email send method is an explicit setting in =LocalSite.cfg=.  If the email send method is set to one of the =Net::SMTP= choices but the
MAILHOST parameter is not set, Foswiki will still fall back to the
=MailProgram= (like =sendmail=).  However if the email method is set to use the =MailProgram= explicitly, it will ignore any hostname set in =MAILHOST= or =SMTPMAILHOST=.

---+++ Password Authentication enhancements [[Foswikitask:Item9164][Item9164]] and [[Foswikitask:Item10962][Item10962]]
The <nop>PasswordManager <code>Foswiki::Users::HtpasswdUser</code> has been enhanced with an <nop>AutoDetect mode to detect the format of the stored password and to validate old passwords using the stored form instead of the encoding configured in <code>{Htpasswd}{Encoding}</code>. Enable this new feature by setting the configuration parameter <code>{Htpasswd}{AutoDetect}</code> to enabled.
   * With this change, it is now possible to migrate to an alternate password Encoding without invalidating existing user passwords.
   * The performance of <code>HtpasswdUser.pm</code> has been improved by up to 30% with large <code>.htpasswd</code> files
   * A new encryption mode - <code>apache-md5</code> has been added. This official Apache variation on MD5 encoding is compatible with the passwords generated by the <code>htpasswd -m</code> command.
   * The encoding previously labeled <code>md5</code> has been renamed to <code>htdigest-md5</code> and is compatible with the encoding generated by the Apache <code>htdigest</code> command.  The config setting will be modified by a config checker the first time you run configure after upgrade.  It is recommended to save your configuration.
      * Note that it is also now possible to modify the <code>{AuthRealm}</code> setting without invalidating existing passwords.
   * Cross-platform compatibility issues between Linux, Apple OSX and MS Windows have been resolved and <code>.htpasswd</code> files should be portable regardless of the selected encoding.
   * The <code>Crypt::PasswdMD5</code> CPAN module is required for the <code>apache-md5</code> encoding, as well as for better cross-platform compatibility.

<blockquote class="foswikiHelp">%X% Note:  It is *strongly* recommended that sites using the old default "crypt" encoding migrate to a stronger method.  The crypt method truncates passwords at 8 characters and silently discards the rest. For the highest security, choose htdigest-md5 encoding with Apache htdigest authentication.  If using Template authentication, if possible use a SSL client connection - HTTPS.</blockquote>

---+++ Changes to User Registration topics [[Foswikitask:Item1539][Item1539]]

The URL parameters passed in from User Registration were previously still prefixed with =Twk=.  This has been changed to =Fwk= to be consistent with Foswiki naming conventions.  Note however that backwards compatbility has been
maintained and either prefix can still be used, so it is not required to update customized User Registration topics.

---+++ Changes to Foswiki Logging - [[Foswikitask:Item10637][Item10637]], [[Foswikitask:Item11157][Item11157]]

A new Logging method has been added: =Foswiki::Logger::PlainFile::Obfuscating=.  If this module is chosen as the Logger, IP addresses by default will be replace with a pseudo-address derived
from a MD5 hash of the original address.  This is provided for use in regulatory domains where systems are not permitted to track IP addresses of
users.  
   * An Expert parameter is provided to use a mask (=x.x.x.x=) instead of the hashed IP address where absolute anonymity is required.
   * Note that AUTHENTICATION FAILURE messages are never obfuscated.  This permits tools like =fail2ban= to be used to block penetration attempts.


---++ Important changes since Foswiki 1.1.2

---+++ Changes to %<nop>GROUPS% and %<nop>GROUPINFO% Macros

See Foswikitask:Item10176. On releases prior to Foswiki 1.1.3 it was possible that the GROUP related macros could expose User WikiNames that would be hidden from the currently autenticated user.  This has been changed, and if the current user does not have VIEW authority for the user's topic, then the user will not be shown as a group member.

There is a subtle difference in operation when using "Hidden" groups, especially when nested in other groups.  Consider the following group structure.
   * !SomeGroup
      * !UserOne
      * !SomeHiddenGroup (VIEW is denied to guest)
         * UserTwo
         * SecretUser (VIEW is denied to guest)

If the Guest uses %<nop>GROUPINFO% or %<nop>GROUPS% to list !SomeGroup,  they will see !UserOne and !UserTwo.   The !SecretUser will not be revealed,  but !SomeHiddenGroup will be expanded.

If the Guest uses %<nop>GROUPINFO% to list groups without expanding nested groups (or visits the %USERSWEB%.WikiGroups topic),  then !SomeHiddenGroup will not be revealed, either directly or as a member of !SomeGroup.

By comparing the expanded list of users of !SomeGroup with the un-expanded list, it is possible to infer by the presence of !UserTwo that there is a hidden group,  but the hidden group name or the hidden users are not revealed.

The important thing to remember:  *If you need to hide the existance of users, protect their user topics.*

---+++ JQueryPlugin update to jQuery 1.4.4

On releases prior to Foswiki 1.1.3, JQueryPlugin shipped with jQuery 1.3.2 enabled. It now uses 1.4.4, and some Foswiki javascript will no longer work correclty with 1.3.2 and earlier. As a result, upgraders will need to
   1 set ={JQueryVersion}= in [[%SCRIPTURLPATH{"configure"}%#JQueryPlugin$Extensions][configure]] under Extensions -> JQueryPlugin to =1.4.4=
   1 [[UpgradeGuide#ManagingBrowserCache][Clear browser cache]]
   1 test non-default plugins and any custom jQuery javascript code for compatibility with jQuery 1.4.4.

---++ Important changes since Foswiki 1.0.10

Foswiki 1.1 has many improvements that end users as well as administrators will appreciate. In addition Foswiki 1.1 comes with a lot of "under the hood" improvements to the core code, with the goal of making it easier to plug in work from other projects, such as jQuery, !KinoSearch, Solr and others. Work has been made to improve the definition of internal APIs to allow other not-yet-written modules, such as store implementations, to plug in. Most of these modifications should be invisible to the end user and the admin, but are important to position Foswiki for the next generation of improvements. Here is a list of the most important enhancements in Foswiki 1.1.0

---+++ Adoption of the jQuery Javascript user interface framework
Since Foswiki 1.1, the industry-standard [[http://jquery.com][jQuery Javascript user interface framework]] has been more closely integrated; the existing !JQueryPlugin is included into the core distribution. Reflecting the move to jQuery, the !BehaviourContrib has been removed from the core distribution; it is still available for download from Foswiki.org. The default !PatternSkin now depends on this jQuery framework.

Also added are the new [[VarADDTOZONE][ADDTOZONE]] and [[VarRENDERZONE][RENDERZONE]] macros that manage dependencies between Javascript modules, making use of this sophisticated toolset much easier. See Foswiki:Development.UpdatingExtensionsScriptZone on how to replace [[VarADDTOHEAD][ADDTOHEAD]] usage.

---++++ New macros enabled by jQuery

   * =BUTTON{"text" ...}= -- renders a nice button
   * =TABPANE{...}=, =ENDTABPANE=, =TAB{"text" ...}=, =ENDTAB= -- tabpane widget
   * =JQICON{"name" ...}= -- render an image
   * =JQICONPATH{"name"}= -- render the urlpath to an image
   * =JQPLUGINS{"plugins" ... }= -- display a summary of avaliable plugins
   * =JQREQUIRE{"plugin, plugin, ... "}= -- enable a plugin on the current page
   * =JQTHEME{"name" ...}= -- switch jQuery UI theme
   * =POPUPWINDOW{"topic" ...}= -- opens a topic or url in a new window

See %SYSTEMWEB%.JQueryPlugin for details.

---+++ Powerful new =QUERY= macro
A number of new features have been added with the goal of improving support for wiki applications. These include the powerful new =QUERY= macro, which:
   * supports formatted access to formfields and other meta-data in topics using the same syntax as is used in =IF= and =SEARCH= statements,
   * gives access to *all* meta-data, including that added by extensions,
   * supports reporting values using JSON and other standards, simplifying the retrieval of meta-data for REST applications,
   * replaces the =FORMFIELD= macro for most applications.

Use of the ="formfield"= parameter to the =META= macro has been deprecated (it is still available, but use is discouraged and it will be removed at some point in the future).

---+++ Re-architecting of the SEARCH macro
To improve the speed, consistency and extendability of the most complex and important Macro, we've started to separate the generation of search results from the outputing of FormattedSearch. The most significant user facing improvements are speed and reliability changes - with many more unit tests written to ensure future compatibility.

---+++ FORMAT macro
The extraction of the FormattedSearch system has made it possible to provide a Macro that allows users to render a list of topics into any =header=, =footer=, =format= style, using the same formatting controls as used by =[[VarSEARCH][SEARCH]]=. This macro will be further enhanced in future Foswiki releases and will play an increaingly important role as it is extended to format other types of object lists.

---+++ %USERSWEB%.WikiGroups have add & remove user interface
!WikiGroups are now be edited using a much simpler HTML form.

For developers additional API's have been added to the Foswiki code to allow these Forms to also be used for non-Foswiki user and group backends.

With some configuration, Foswiki can also add users to groups on registration - either automatically, or allowing the users to select groups to join.

---+++ TinyMCEPlugin updates
TinyMCEPlugin has been updated to the latest 3.3 release from Moxiecode. Additionally, several improvements to the Foswiki integration have been made, such as:
   * Smarter attach dialogue
   * Background autosave feature has been enabled (saves to local browser storage at 3 minute intervals)
   * New context (right-click) menu:
      * Set syntax highlighting classes on verbatim blocks
      * table rows/columns may be duplicated, cells merged/split
   * Customisation via the =TINYMCEPLUGIN_INIT= preference has been improved. [[TinyMCEPlugin#UpgradeFrom01x00][Read the upgrade advice]] if you are upgrading a Foswiki installation which uses a custom =TINYMCEPLUGIN_INIT= preference setting.

---+++ Testing configuration variables in %IF
Prior to 1.1, =%<nop>IF= could be used to test the value of any configuration variable (those defined in =configure=). This represented a security risk, so now only those variables listed in ={AccessibleCFG}= may be accessed this way. Note that ={AccessibleCFG}= also controls which variables are visible in =%<nop>SEARCH{type="query"= and the new [[VarQUERY][QUERY]] macro.

---+++ "Copy topic" now copies attachments
The "Copy Topic" function in "More topic actions" now copies attachments as well as the topic text and form.

---+++ Tailoring of user registration made easier.

The topic System.UserRegistration has been enhanced so it now determines whether a custom user registration page exists in %USERSWEB%, and includes it if it does; otherwise it includes DefaultUserRegistration.

This means that your tailored version in %USERSWEB% web will not be overwritten by future upgrades.

You can create a custom version of the UserRegistration form by first copying the topic DefaultUserRegistration to !UserRegistration in %USERSWEB% web. This will ensure that your changes will remain intact next time you upgrade.

A couple of common fields are hidden from normal view to make the registration page as simple as possible. You can unhide those fields on the page by removing =EXCLUDED_= from the =INCLUDE= tags).

---+++ Easy tailoring of reset/change password and change email forms

The topics %SYSTEMWEB%.ResetPassword and %SYSTEMWEB%.ChangePassword now only show the change forms when Foswiki is managing the passwords (the =configure= setting ={PasswordManager}= set to a manager that handles setting of passwords).

If the {PasswordManager} does not support password changing, the ChangePassword and ResetPassword topics will show a simple message. This message is defined iby the preference =CHANGEPASSWORDDISABLEDMESSAGE= in %SYSTEMWEB%.DefaultPreferences. You can redefine this setting by copying it to %USERSWEB%.SitePreferences and change it to include a link to the password management website of your organisation.

ChangeEmailAddress will now guide the user to define the email address in the user topic when the !PasswordManager does not handle hidden email addresses, so you should not need to tailor this topic any longer.

---+++ TMPL:DEFs may now access previous (overridden) TMPL:DEF
SkinTemplates authors are often limited by the fact that =%<nop>TMPL:DEF{"something"}%= statements override whatever DEF may have previously existed in the SKIN path. Now, when overriding these DEFs, SkinTemplates authors may access the previous definition using the new =%<nop>TMPL:PREV%= template token.

---+++ New Logging architecture and location for log files
The Foswiki logging architecture has been changed to make processing of the "current" logs easier, and the logs have been moved from the =data/= directory into =working/logs=.  The configuration of the logging files have also been updated.  

*If Foswiki detects the presence of the old logging configuration, it will continue to use the old files.  =configure= will issue warnings about the deprecated settings.*

|  *Foswiki 1.0.x*  |  *Foswiki 1.1.x*  ||
|  *Current & Prior*  |  *Current Month*  |  *Prior Months*  |
| =foswiki-root/data/logYYYYMM= | =foswiki-root/working/logs/events.log= | =foswiki-root/working/logs/events.YYYYMM= |
| =foswiki-root/data/warnYYYYMM= | =foswiki-root/working/logs/warn.log= | =foswiki-root/working/logs/warn.YYYYMM= |
| =foswiki-root/data/error.log= | =foswiki-root/working/logs/error.log= | =foswiki-root/working/logs/error.YYYYMM= |
| =foswiki-root/data/debug.txt= | =foswiki-root/working/logs/debug.log= | =foswiki-root/working/logs/debug.YYYYMM= | 
| =foswiki-root/data/configurationlog.txt= | =foswiki-root/working/logs/configure.log= | _The configuratiog log does not roll_  |

---++++ Migration considerations

Foswiki provides two Logger implementations selectable in =configure=.  =Foswiki::Logger::Plainfile= implements the new file naming conventions and locations.  =Foswiki::Logger::Compatibility= uses the old locations and settings.  The Compatibility logger is used if the old file locations are detected in the configuration.

The primary use of the logs by Foswiki is for generation of Statistics. If changing to the new logger ( *strongly recommended* ) it is best to get a full statistics refresh prior to migration. Copy / rename the log files into their new location using the above table as a guide.  Manually edit =lib/LocalSite.cfg= to remove the obsolete parameters, and then run configure to verify the new settings.

---+++++ Logging Configuration 

The 1.0 configuration settings should be manually removed from LocalSite.cfg, and configure then used to verify the new settings.  With 1.1.3, if any of the 1.0 Debug, Warning or Log filenames are found, the "compatibility" logger will be used regardless of the =Implementation= setting.

---+++ Logging of access failures
Configure and !TemplateLogin now log authentication failures to the event logs:

   * =working/logs/configure.log=
   * =working/logs/events.log=
 
It is possible to monitor these logs with a product like =fail2ban= which will set firewall filters due to excessive failures.

---+++ =configure= user interface revamp
Also included in 1.1 is a major improvement to the =configure= user interface, that clarifies and simplifies setting configuration options.

---+++ Configure file system checks
The configuration tool =bin/configure= now performs extensive checks of file system permissions. The pub and data directories are checked to verify that all data files match the requested default permissions of =755= for directories and =644= for data files. Files with excess permissions are reported as a warning. Files with insufficient permissions are noted as an error.

Because of prior inconsistencies in the files distributed with Foswiki and TWiki core and extensions, migration of older Foswiki or TWiki installs may see excessive errors reported by configure. You are recommended to correct the file system permissions. 

---+++ CompareRevisionsAddOn - security considerations

CompareRevisionsAddOn is now included by default.  If you choose to use this
extensions to replace the =rdiff= command, the following items must be
addressed.

   * If =rdiff= or =rdiffauth= are listed in $Foswiki::cfg{AuthScripts} - then compare should be added. As there is no equivalent =compareauth= script, then compare should be protected.
   * The =compare= script should be added to the Apache configuration if Apache authentication is required.  Protect =compare= explicitly as it will not be covered by the match for *auth.
   * The =compare= script should also be added to the Log actions list
<verbatim>
$Foswiki::cfg{Log}{Action} = {
...
          'compare' => 1,
...
                  };
</verbatim>


---+++ Newer modern icon set for Document Graphics
To celebrate our new look, project and momentum, Foswiki now has a new ICON set to update the one shipped for the last 10 years. Using the !FamFamFam icon set, augmented with icons from other leading graphic artists.

---+++ Table Plugin has been improved
HTML formatting has been replaced by pure CSS rendering. You can however enable inline markup HTML, in addition to the CSS markup, by setting the new parameter =inlinemarkup= to "on". This is useful if your users often copy/paste content of topics containing tables into HTML formatted emails or Office documents.

Sorting has been improved so the plugin can now better handle mix of formats and even empty cells.

---+++ Notes for extension authors

---++++ API Enhancements
The following functions have been added to the =Foswiki::Func= API:
   * [[System/PerlDoc?module=Foswiki::Func#copyAttachment_40_36web_44_36topic_44_36attachment_44_36newWeb_44_36newTopic_44_36newAttachment_41][=copyAttachment=]]

New parameters can be found on:

   * =saveTopic= (=ignorepermissions=)

---++++ Deprecated handlers
The following handlers have been deprecated (i.e. they are still available, but should not be used in new code and will be removed in a future release, so if you have been used them, you need to modify your code).

The =redirectCGIQueryHandler= plugin handler has been deprecated (it is still available, but should not be used in new code and will be removed in a future release, so if you have been used it, you need to modify your code). This handler assumed a level of interaction with the CGI handling process that is dangerous if misused, and severely limits the flexibility and optimisations available to the core.

The =beforeAttachmentSaveHandler= and =afterAttachmentSaveHandler= plugin handlers have been deprecated in favour of the newly-added =beforeUploadHandler= and =afterUploadHandler=. The new handlers operate on streams, and are more efficient as well as more secure.

Deprecated handlers will continue to work as documented in 1.1 and for the immediate future, but will be removed in a future release. Extension authors are strongly recommended to implement the new handlers as soon as possible.

---++++ Deprecated Foswiki::Func functions
The =readTopicText= and =saveTopicText= functions have been deprecated. Use =readTopic= and =saveTopic= instead. Both =readTopic= and =saveTopic= have always been available in Foswiki (and its predecessor) and are a lot safer. Existing code can usually be modified to eliminate these deprecated functions without difficulty.

__Note:__ =readTopicText= had implicit access control checks. The replacement method, =readTopic= does not, so calling code must call =checkAccessPermission= explicitly.

---++++ Refactored =Foswiki::Store= and new =Foswiki::Meta= functions
Access checking has been moved from Store up to the Meta and Func routines. This was done to improve perfomance of the Store backend and simplify implementation of different stores e.g. using databases.

Store was never part of the Foswiki or TWiki API. Extensions which violate this API and reference =Store::= functions directly could potentially have access that was previously blocked by Foswiki and/or may require other changes to be compatible with Foswiki 1.1.

Extension authors should first try to use the =Foswiki::Func= API. This is the preferred API. Pay careful attention to whether or not each =Func::= method verifies access control and use the =Foswiki::Func::checkAccessPermission= to verify access.

=Foswiki::Meta= should be used only if =Foswiki::Func= does not have a needed function. Note that =Foswiki::Meta= functions do not implicitly perform any access control checks. Callers of =Foswiki::Meta== should first use the =Foswiki::Meta::haveAccess= function to verify access for the planned actions. This was done by design to reduce repetitive access control checks and improve performance.

---++++ Tainting
The Foswiki core now checks values used for web, topic and attachment names for 'taintedness' when =FOSWIKI_ASSERTS= are enabled. Tainted values are those that have been taken from user input (for example, from topic content or from form fields) without being validated. Such unchecked values are a large potential security hole, and the authors of plugins that manipulate topics or attachments need to check their plugins with Foswiki ASSERTs enabled. If you find a taint error, you can use the functions in =Foswiki::Sandbox= to validate them. For example, to validate a web name and a topic name, you would write:

<verbatim>
$validWebName = Foswiki::Sandbox::untaint(
    $webName, \&Foswiki::Sandbox::validateWebName);
$validTopicName = Foswiki::Sandbox::untaint(
    $topicName, \&Foswiki::Sandbox::validateWebName);
</verbatim>

If =$webName= is not a legal web name, then =$webName= will end up being undefined. Similarly for the topic name.

Note that values are only checked for taintedness when =FOSWIKI_ASSERTS= are enabled, so unless you run your Foswiki in this mode, you will never see the errors. To enable asserts, simply add the line:

<verbatim>
$ENV{FOSWIKI_ASSERTS} = 1;
</verbatim>

to your =bin/LocalLib.cfg=.
