# bin/.htaccess.txt
#
# Controls access to Foswiki scripts - to make Apache use it, rename this
# file to '.htaccess' and REPLACE THE FOLLOWING STRINGS WHEREVER YOU SEE
# THEM IN THIS FILE WITH PATHS SPECIFIC TO YOUR INSTALLATION.
# Most required values can be seen in the Path Settings section of
# =configure=.
#
# Replace {DataDir} with the value from =configure=
# Replace {DefaultUrlHost} with the value from =configure=
# Replace {ScriptUrlPath} with the value from =configure=
# Replace {Administrators} with a space-separated list of the login
# name(s) of the person(s) allowed to run the configure script
# e.g. admin root superhero

# We set an environment variable called anonymous_spider
# Setting a BrowserMatchNoCase to ^$ is important. It prevents Foswiki from
# including its own topics as URLs and also prevents other Foswikis from
# doing the same. This is important to prevent the most obvious
# Denial of Service attacks.
# You can expand this by adding more BrowserMatchNoCase statements to
# block evil browser agents trying the impossible task of mirroring a Foswiki
# Example:
# BrowserMatchNoCase ^SiteSucker anonymous_spider
BrowserMatchNoCase ^$ anonymous_spider

# Now set default access rights.

# Use CGI & Perl to handle all files in 'bin' directory, i.e. run as scripts -
# this should remove the need to rename files to end in '.pl' etc, if your web
# hosting provider permits this.  Remove if using mod_perl.  Look at
# http://foswiki.org/Extensions/FastCGIEngineContrib to get info about FastCGI
# support.

# These are scripts that might change content. The regular expression uses ".*"
# at the end so it matches the scripts even if you had to add a .cgi or .pl
# extension. If you want to require login for any other scripts, modify the
# regular expression below as appropriate.

# NB. The resetpasswd & passwd scripts are used to reset and change passwords.
# They do their own validation of the user and therefore
# should not use "require valid-user"

# When using Apache type login the following defines the Foswiki scripts
