#VarRENDERZONE
---+++ RENDERZONE

<verbatim class="tml">
%RENDERZONE{"zone" ...}%
</verbatim>
See [[VarADDTOZONE][ADDTOZONE]] for an explanation of _zones_.

Parameters:
   * ="zone"= required, name of the zone.
   * =format="..."= optional, format string for each item added to the zone, default:
   <verbatim class="tml">$item <!--<literal> $id $missing</literal>--></verbatim>Tokens:
      * =$id= - =id= of the [[VarADDTOZONE][ADDTOZONE]] call within the =zone= currently being rendered.
      * =$item= - text of the [[VarADDTOZONE][ADDTOZONE]] call within the =zone= currently being rendered.
      * =$zone= - the ="zone"= currently being rendered.
      * =$missing= - if the [[VarADDTOZONE][ADDTOZONE]] call being rendered required any =id= which was not found, then =$missing= is the =missingtoken= parameter; empty string otherwise.
      * =$missingids= - comma separated list of ids that were required by the [[VarADDTOZONE][ADDTOZONE]] call currently being rendered but weren't found within this =zone=.
   * =missingtoken="..."= optional, this will be the string assigned to the =$missing= format token for use in the =format= parameter. Default:
   <verbatim class="tml">$id: requires= missing ids: $missingids</verbatim>
   * =chomp="on"= remove leading and trailing whitespace from formatted items, can be useful for pretty-printing and compression.
   * =header="..."= optional, prepended to the output
   * =footer="..."= optional, appended to the output
   * =separator="..."= optional, put between each item of a zone
Supports the [[FormatTokens][standard format tokens]] in all parameters.

__Notes:__
   * =header= and =footer= are *not* output if there is no content in the
     zone (nothing has been ADDTOZONEd). However they *are* output if the
     output is the empty string (at least one ADDTOZONE has been processed).
   * Zones are cleared after being rendered; they are only ever rendered once.
   * =head= and =body= are _automatic zones_. They don't require a
     corresponding =RENDERZONE= anywhere in the templates - they are
     automatically inserted before the =&lt;/head&gt;= and =&lt;/body&gt;=
     of the output HTML page.
   * If ={OptimizePageLayout}= is *disabled* in
     [[%SCRIPTURL{"configure"}%/configure][configure]] (the default),
     then the content of both the =head= *and* the =body= zones will
     be inserted where the =head= zone is expanded, and nothing will be
     inserted where the =&lt;/body&gt;= zone is expanded.

See also [[VarADDTOZONE][ADDTOZONE]] for more information on zones.
