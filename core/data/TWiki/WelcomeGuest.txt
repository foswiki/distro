---+!! Welcome, %WIKIUSERNAME%!

Welcome to <nop>%WIKITOOLNAME%! This is a TWikiSite (pronounced _twee-kee site_), a meeting place to work on common interests. Anyone can contribute using any web browser. <nop>%WIKITOOLNAME% looks like a normal web site... except that it encourages contribution and *editing* of pages, questions, answers, comments and updates.

"Wiki" systems are fundamentally editable web pages.  It's a fun and useful way of communicating asynchronously over the web for many existing intranet and public Internet sites.  TWiki is simple to learn and use.  It aims to provide a transparent way for you to publish and exchange your ideas with others over the web.

%TOC%

---++ What's in a TWiki?

   * *Webs:* A TWikiSite is divided into webs, each one represents an area for collaboration. This site has the following webs: %WEBLIST{ format="[[$name.%HOMETOPIC%][$name]]" separator=", " }%
   * *Topics:* Each web is made up of hyperlinked [[TWikiTopics][topics]] that appear in your browser.

---++ Some things to do

   * *Browse.* This is a site like other sites. Read and follow interesting links.
   * *Write.* Speak your mind! From your browser you can change or add to anything you see in a TWiki topic. Use regular text or TWikiShorthand.
   * *Experiment.*  Edit your personal page or visit the Sandbox.%HOMETOPIC% web.
   * *Organize.* You can learn to use TWikiForms and [[FormattedSearch]]es to include topic information - for example, classify pages by subject, status, or date.
   * *Learn more.* Some good places to start:
      * TWikiTutorial is a 20-minute tour of TWiki essentials. 
      * BeginnersStartHere is a short introduction training course for beginners. 
      * WikiReferences links to selected articles and books about wiki technology and online collaboration.
      * WikiSyntax - simple syntax for edits

---++ Some basics

---+++ Editing a page:
   * click ==Edit== at the bottom of any topic and make your changes
   * click ==[&nbsp;Preview&nbsp;Changes&nbsp;]== at the bottom to verify the topic (use your brower's ==Back== button if necessary)
   * click ==[&nbsp;Save&nbsp;Changes&nbsp;]== You've now edited the topic!

---+++ Creating a page

See a question mark link "<u>?</u>" behind a !WikiWord? That means that there's no topic yet for that Sandbox.NewWikiWord%CALC{$INT($RAND(100000))}%. If you want to create a topic for that !WikiWord, just click on the question mark. The topic will be created and you will be in the editor window.

Click ==History== at the bottom of a topic
