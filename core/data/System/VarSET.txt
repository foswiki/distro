---+ SET -- set a preference setting during runtime

A preference setting created via %SET will only be usable on the topic where it has been found by the
parser, similar to normal PreferenceSettings.  Each call to %INCLUDE opens a new scope of preference variables being
used.  An %INCLUDE of another topic containing a %SET statement will _not_
assert those values in the current topic's scope. In contrast, a TMPL:DEF template definition
containing %SET macros will add those values to the current scope as if these settings have been 
parsed as part of the current topic's text. 

Setting a preference setting in a list like in

<verbatim class="tml">
   * Set foo = %SEARCH{...
</verbatim>

will store the _text_ of the TML expression.

The equivalent %SET statement:

<verbatim class="tml">
%SET{"foo" value="%SEARCH{..."}%
</verbatim>

will store the _result_ of the TML expression as a consequence of the parser processing
macros inside-out-left-to-right.

---++ Examples
To cache the result of another macro use =%<nop>SET{"search_result" value="%<nop>SEARCH{...}%"}%=. The result of the =value= expression will be temporarily bound to the variable =%<nop>search_result%= and might be used within the scope of the current topic being processed
