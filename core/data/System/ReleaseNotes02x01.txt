---++ Foswiki - The Free and Open Source Wiki

Foswiki is an enterprise collaboration and information sharing tool targeted for professional use in many types of organizations: from small businesses to multi-nationals, from one-product open source groups, to worldwide research networks.

Foswiki is a wiki: fundamentally, a website with editable web pages. It looks like a normal web site but it encourages contributions, edits, updates, questions, and answers from its users. It's a powerful way of enabling a community to communicate asynchronously using intranet and public Internet websites. Foswiki is simple to learn and use. It aims to provide a transparent way for you to publish and exchange your ideas with others over the web and eliminates the one-webmaster syndrome of outdated intranet content.

Foswiki is a structured wiki with tools that enable users without programming skills to build powerful yet simple applications to process information and support workflows. Developers can extend the functionality of Foswiki with plugins.

Foswiki is backwards compatible with content generated on all previous Foswiki versions, and even content and many plugins from TWiki installations (Foswiki ships with a !TWikiCompatibilityPlugin, thus enabling most extensions made for TWiki to work in Foswiki. TWiki<sup>&reg;</sup> is a registered trademark of Peter Thoeny.)

Foswiki is released under the GNU General Public License.

---++ Known issues
For up-to-date information, see [[https://foswiki.org/Support/KnownIssuesOfFoswiki02x01][Known issues of Foswiki 2.1]]

---+++ Use of non-default ={Store}{Encoding}=

*WARNING* About ={Store}{Encoding}=: If you intend to use high-bit characters in attachment filenames (such as umlauts and accents), then links to these
attachments on Foswiki pages *will not work* on a non-utf-8 Store without modification. This is because Foswiki works internally using Unicode, but the store saves files to disk using your chosen
{Store}{Encoding}. Running the Store with other than =utf-8= encoding is considered a transitional step and not recommended for long-term operation.
The *strongly recommended* solution is to convert your store to UTF8 at the earliest opportunity.

A partial workaround is implemented in the PubLinkFixupPlugin This Plugin will attempt to rewrite broken links.  This _generally_ gets linked images and other attachments working.
However the TinyMCEPlugin is still unable to render image links while editing a topic.

See [[%BUGS%/Item13696][Item13696]] for up-to-date details.

---++ Important changes in Foswiki 2.1.1
---+++ Page Caching
The Foswiki PageCache has added another index on the dependencies table.
After installing this update, you should issue the =refresh=all= option to
drop the foswiki cache tables, and allow them to be recreated.  This will
create the new index.

---+++ JQuery
This release updates to a newer maintenance version of JQuery.  You should
visit =bin/configure= and select the updated versions of JQuery.

---+++ New CPAN dependency, and foswiki.org changes
Due to upstream changes, the Perl LWP package has been split into two
packages.  You may need to install =LWP::Protocol::https= for https support in
extension installation and accessing remote sites with the INCLUDE macro.

---++ Important changes in Foswiki 2.1

---+++ Deprecations

The =%<nop>HTTP%= and =%<nop>HTTPS%= macros are deprecated and will be removed in a future release.  These macros now restrict the available information to the
=Accept-language= and =User-Agent= headers.  The list of available headers is now configurable.

The PatternSkin created =contentheader= and =contentfooter= as aliases for the =beforetext= and =aftertext= templates and deprecated the older templates.  As
this broke compatibity with other skins, that deprecation has been reversed.  For best compatibiliy continue to use =beforetext= and =aftertext=.

---++ API Change

The Foswiki API version is incremented to version 2.4 in Foswiki 2.1.0.  Foswiki 2.1 permits template names using Unicode characters.

---+++ New Perl CPAN dependencies!
<div class="foswikiHelp">
*Foswiki now requires CPAN:Email::MIME*. Foswiki will be unable to send email without this module. SystemRequirements has more details on CPAN dependencies and
package names for most *nix distributions.
</div>

---+++ Enhanced Registration form

The registration form now accepts the parameter =templatename= to override the default NewUserTemplate.  In addition the registration topics have been
restructured to permit multiple custom registration pages. Customization of the registration form is greatly simplified.

---+++ Easier to restrict access to the System web.

Some sites prefer to block access to the System web documentation for guest users.  Duplicated content can result in lowered search engine rank, so it is
advantageous to restrict access to the System web. Foswiki now includes =ALLOWTOPICVIEW= settings for critical system topics that are required for guest access.

---+++ Changes in permitted characters in topic and attachment names.

Foswiki has split the topic and attachment name filters. The topic name filter has become more restrictive. Attachment names now permit embedded spaces, and
attachments with spaces will no longer be renamed to underscores. If you would prefer to use the old behavior, enable =$Foswiki::cfg{AttachmentReplaceSpaces}=.

<div class="foswikiHelp"> *Action Required:* The colon (:) has been removed from the list of legal characters permitted in topic names.  The colon was in
conflict with the InterWiki links. If your existing topic use the colon in topic names, you should remove the colon from the configuration setting
=$Foswiki::cfg{NameFilter}=.
</div>

---+++ Improvements in International Character Set support

Foswiki 2.1 has further improved support for =utf-8= based character sets. Topics and data forms can use utf-8 characters.  They will be properly rendered and
preserved during edit.   The Foswiki core has been fully converted to utf-8 and unicode. All encoding / decoding is done "at the edge", when reading from
/ writing to the Foswiki store.

   * Foswiki 2.1 International support
      * Emails sent by Foswiki now fully support International Character Sets.
      * Foswiki now uses NFC Normalization of Unicode characters. This greatly improves compatibility with Operating Systems like OSX which use NFD form characters by default.
      * Template names are no longer restricted to ASCII characters. 

   * Foswiki 2.0 International support
      * New sites will use utf-8 by default.  Internationalizaiton should just work.
      * Sites migrating data from a previous installation have two choices:
         * Set ={Store}{Encoding} to match the previous ={Site}{CharSet}=. (Default was =iso-8859-1=)
         * Migrate the data to utf-8 by using the =tools/bulk_copy.pl= script. This is the recommended solution.
      * Support for Locales is still known to have issues.  ={UseLocales}= should not be enabled in the configuration.

<div class='foswikiHelp'>%X% *ACTION REQUIRED* If you are upgrading an existing system, you
should review the existing data and determine if migration to utf-8 should be performed.
See the [[%FO%/System.UpgradeGuide][UpgradeGuide]] for more details. Note that the topic and
attachment name filters no longer filter international characters, so migration to utf-8 is
strongly recommended.

Due to the extensive internal changes, extensions may require changes for
compatibility with this release.
   * See [[%FO%/Support.Utf8MigrationConsiderations][Utf8MigrationConsiderations]] for guidance on upgrading local extensions
   * See [[%BUGS%/Item13483][Item13483]] for known extensions compatibility issues.
