<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/screenshot1.png" alt="" width="60%" style="float:right" />

%TOC%

Features:
   1 You can edit one row, or even one cell at a time, instead of having to edit the entire
     table.
   1 Supports footer rows.
   1 Supports sorting columns in tables using Javascript, avoiding the
     round-trip to the server required by !TablePlugin.
   1 Simple interface to moving rows around in the table, deleting and
     adding rows.
   1 Gets row numbering right (takes account of headers).
   1 It's _much_ faster than the individual plugins it replaces.
   1 (geeky) Coded using a clean object-oriented architecture, which
     makes it easily extensible.
   1 (geeky) Uses a simple REST interface for saving changes, which allows
     Javascript table editors to use the same interface to save.
   1 (geeky) Tolerant to Javascript being disabled in the browser

Note that this plugin is designed for use with tables of up to ~1000 rows. Tables
larger than this will work, but they put considerable stress on the browser
and the server. For manipulating larger tables, you are recommended to investigate
Foswiki:Extensions.JQGridPlugin.

---++ Usage

Works like the !EditTablePlugin (it uses exactly the same =%EDITTABLE= macro)
and you can use it to edit the entire table, or just one row at a time.

An =%<nop>EDITTABLE{...}%= in the topic will be associated with the next table
in the topic. If there is no existing table, or another
=%<nop>EDITTABLE{...}%= is seen before the next table, then a new table will
be created.

Parameters:

   * ==format== - The format of the cells in a row of the table. The format is
     defined like a table row, where the cell data specify the type for each
     cell. For example, =format="| text,16 | label |"=. Cells can be any of
     the following types:
      * =text, &lt;size&gt;, &lt;initial value&gt;= Simple text field. Initial value is optional.
      * =textarea, &lt;rows&gt;x&lt;columns&gt;, &lt;initial value&gt;=
        Multirow text box. Initial value is optional.
      * =select, &lt;size&gt;, &lt;option 1&gt;, &lt;option 2&gt;, etc=
        Select one from a list of choices.
      * =radio, &lt;size&gt;, &lt;option 1&gt;, &lt;option 2&gt;,= etc.
        Radio buttons. =size=
        indicates the number of buttons per line in edit mode.
      * =checkbox, &lt;size&gt;, &lt;option 1&gt;, &lt;option 2&gt;, etc=
        Checkboxes. =size=
        indicates the number of buttons per line in edit mode.
      * =label, 0, &lt;label text&gt;= Fixed label.
      * =row= The row number, automatically worked out.
      * =date, &lt;size&gt;, &lt;initial value&gt;, &lt;DHTML date format&gt;= Date. Initial value and date format are both optional.
   * ==changerows== - Rows can be added and removed if ="on"=. Rows can be
     added but not removed if ="add"=. Defaults to the value of the
     [[%SYSTEMWEB%.Macros][preference]] =CHANGEROWS=, or ="on"= if it isn't set.
   * ==disable== - By default, the plugin shows both full table and individual row editing controls.
     You can choose to disable one or both of these modes using the =disable= parameter, by setting it to =row= or =full=
     (or =row,full= to disable all editing and just leave sorting). If full table editing is disabled, but =changerows= is =on=,
     then the <button type="button" class="erp-edittable"></button> (edit table) button will be replaced with a
     <button type="button" class="erp-addrow""></button> (add row) button. Defaults to the value of the
     [[%SYSTEMWEB%.Macros][preference]] =EDITROWPLUGIN_DISABLE=, or =none= if it isn't set.
   * ==buttons== - set to =left= (the default) or =right= to position edit controls in the first or last columns in the table. =buttons="right"= may be required if you are using other plugins that expect a certain column order.
   * ==quietsave== - Quiet Save button is shown if ="on"=. Defaults to the
     value of the [[%SYSTEMWEB%.Macros][preference]] =QUIETSAVE=, or =off= if it
     isn't set.
   * ==include== -
     Name of another topic defining the EDITTABLE parameters. The first
     %<nop>EDITTABLE% in the topic is used. This is useful if you have many
     topics with the same table format and you want to update the format in
     one place.
   * ==headerrows== -
     Number of rows to treat as headers. Header rows are not 
     editable, and will not be sorted. =headerislabel= is also 
     supported for EditTablePlugin compatibility (equivalent 
     to =headerrows="1"=)
   * ==header== -
     Specify the single-row header format of a new table. For example,
     ="%VBAR%*Food*%VBAR%*Drink*%VBAR%"=. Provided to allow you to create a new table in a document, and to have a header that is truly readonly. If =header=
     is defined on an empty table then a header row will be automatically
     created.<br />
     NOTE: if neither =header= nor =headerrows= is given, but there are
     existing headers in the table (rows in which every column is bold)
     then those rows will automatically be taken as the table header.
   * ==footerrows== -
     Number of rows to treat as footers. Footer rows are not 
     editable and will not be sorted.
   * ==orientrowedit== -
     unique to !EditRowPlugin, this parameter controls the 
     orientation of a row when it is being edited. It can be
     set to =horizontal= (the default) or =vertical=, which
     will present the columns of the row as rows in the editor. This makes
     editing very wide tables much easier. Has no effect in whole table
     editing mode.
   * ==helptopic== Topic name containing help text shown when editing a table. The [[VarSTARTINCLUDE][%<nop>STARTINCLUDE%]] and [[VarSTOPINCLUDE][%<nop>STOPINCLUDE%]] markers can be used in the topic to specify what is shown. Note that newlines are removed from the included text so the that text can be used inside a table.
   * ==js== gives local, per-table control over the =EDITROWPLUGIN_JS= preference <a href="#js">described below</a>.
Table rows are shown with a row edit button %UICON%pencil%NOCIU% in the first column,
and a table edit button <button type="button" class="erp-edittable"></button> after the
table. When the table is
edited, then a number of buttons may be shown depending on the
settings of =changerows= and =quietsave=.
   * %UICON%disk%NOCIU% saves the changes
   * <button type="button" class="erp-button erp-quietsave"></button> saves without notification
   * %UICON%plusthick%NOCIU% adds a new row after the current row, taking for its contents the initial values specified in the EDITTABLE macro
   * %UICON%minusthick%NOCIU% deletes the row
   *  %UICON%arrow-1-n%NOCIU% Move this row up one row in the table
   * %UICON%arrow-1-s%NOCIU% Move this row down one row in the table
   * %UICON%cancel%NOCIU% cancels the open edit

---++ Per Cell Settings

An individual edit field type can be defined for each individual table cell. Place an =%<nop>EDITCELL{ "type, ..." }%= macro at the end of the cell content. This is useful to override the per column =%<nop>EDITTABLE{ format="..." }%= settings, or to create tables with key/value rows. All edit field types of the =format="..."= parameter are supported. For example, to define a text field, type: =| cell content %<nop>EDITCELL{ "text, 20" }% |=

__Note:__ The =%<nop>EDITCELL{}%= macro cannot be used by itself; place an =%<nop>EDITTABLE{ }%= macro at the beginning of a table where you want to use =%<nop>EDITCELL{ }%= macros.

---++ Examples
Copy the following examples and paste them into a topic in the %SANDBOXWEB% web
(or another web where you have write access). The !EditRowPlugin is
%IF{"{Plugins}{EditRowPlugin}{Enabled}"
else=" *not* enabled on this site, so the examples will be disabled."
then="enabled in this site. Click on the buttons to try it out."}%

---+++ Javascript Editing
<div style="float:right">
=%<nop>EDITTABLE{ format="| text,12 | textarea, 3x30 |" js="assumed"}%= <br />
<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/screenshot2.png"></div>
When a table is editable and Javascript is enabled, then when the user rolls the mouse over a table row:
   * individual table cells have a yellow stain <button type="button" class="erp-editbutton"></button> on the corner that can be clicked to open an in-place editor,
   * table rows *that contain at least one editable cell* can be manually sorted using drag-and-drop, by dragging the %UICON%arrowthick-2-n-s%NOCIU% (though beware that a =TABLE= tag with an =initsort= will override this, which can be confusing),
Table columns can be sorted in the browser, by clicking the heading above the row.

Note that javascript editing is automatically disabled if:
   * The current user does not have CHANGE access to the topic
   * No user is logged in, but the =rest= script is listed in the ={AuthScripts}= admin setting.

<a name="js"></a>
---++ Preferences
The plugin interprets a couple of [[%SYSTEMWEB%.Macros][preferences]], in common with the !EditTablePlugin.
| =QUIETSAVE= | Gives a default value for the =quietsave= parameter. Default is =off=. |
| =CHANGEROWS= | Gives a default value for the =changerows= parameter. Default is =on=. |
Also, the plugin has a couple of its own settings:
| =EDITROWPLUGIN_JS= | Usually the plugin expects to be able to use Javascript to generate controls. However sometimes users disable Javascript in the browser, so the plugin also generates a minimal set of fallback controls to give non-JS access to the main features, even if Javascript is disabled. You can use this preference to control whether Javascript is preferred, ignored, or assumed when generating the controls.<ul><li> =preferred= means "use JS if it's available, but keep the non-JS fallback controls visible", </li><li> =ignored= means "never use JS, only display the non-JS controls", </li><li> =assumed= means "assume that JS will be available in the browser, and don't display the fallback controls". </li></ul> You can control the setting on a per-table basis using the =js= parameter to the =EDITTABLE= macro. |
| =EDITROWPLUGIN_DISABLE= | Set to =on= to disable the plugin. Default is =off=. |
These preferences can be defined in %LOCALSITEPREFS%, in <nop>%WEBPREFSTOPIC% for an individual web, or in the topic.

There is also a =configure= (expert) setting that allows you to change the name of the macro used to carry table editor parameters. This is usually =EDITTABLE= but can be changed to help work around problems with other plugins.

---++ Installation Instructions

%$INSTALL_INSTRUCTIONS%

---++ Using the REST API
The plugin provides a couple of useful [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer][REST]] handlers. Javascript developers may find
this API useful when developing their own tools that
manipulate tables.

There are two entry points, =get= and =save=. The =get= handler can be used to retrieve the contents of
a table. Parameters are:
   * =erp_topic= the web.wikiname of the topic
   * =erp_table= the table (numbered from 1)
   * =erp_row= - the row (numbered from 1)
   * =erp_col= - the column (numbered from 1)
The handler returns a row, a column, or the entire table depending on the presence of the =erp_row=
and =erp_col= parameters. If neither is given, the entire table is returned. If only =erp_row= is given, just that row will be returned, etc. The data is returned in JSON format.

For example, a URI to retrieve column 2 from the table =EDITTABLE_1= from this topic would look like this:

[[%SCRIPTURL{rest}%/EditRowPlugin/get?erp_topic=%WEB%.%TOPIC%;erp_table=EDITTABLE_1;erp_col=2]]

The =save= handler is used to save cells, and accepts the following parameters:
   * =erp_topic= the web.wikiname of the topic to be changed
   * =erp_table= the table to be changed (numbered from 1)
   * =erp_row= - the row to be changed (numbered from 1, or -1 for the whole table)
   * =saveRowCmd.x= - if nonzero, this is a save
   * =saveRowQuietlyCmd.x= - if nonzero, this is a quietsave
   * =upRowCmd.x= - if nonzero, this is a row move
   * =downRowCmd.x= - if nonzero, this is a  row move
   * =deleteRowCmd.x= - if nonzero, this is a row deletion
   * =cancelCmd.x= - if nonzero, this is a cancel
   * =noredirect= - if set, suppresses the redirect and gets a status code instead
The value of each individual cell is stored in a parameter called =erp_&lt;table>_&lt;row>_&lt;column>=

---++ Relationship to other plugins
---+++ !EditTablePlugin
At this time most features of !EditTablePlugin are supported. Known exceptions
are:
   * the =editbutton= parameter,
   * Plugin preferences (though global preferences are compatible)
---+++ !TablePlugin
Javascript sorting in !EditRowPlugin is much faster than !TablePlugin. However
!TablePlugin has many features this plugin does not support. For the most part,
the two plugins can safely be used together. *However* if you use a TABLE statement with
an =initsort= parameter, it is likely to cause great confusion, as the table will be
re-sorted each time a row is opened for edit, and when the table is edited in full table
mode.

---+++ !EditTablerowPlugin
Provides the vertical row editing interface like
!EditTablerowPlugin, with the row being edited shown in context in the table.
