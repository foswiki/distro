---+ package Foswiki::Plugins::EmptyPlugin

Foswiki plugins 'listen' to events happening in the core by registering an
interest in those events. They do this by declaring 'plugin handlers'. These
are simply functions with a particular name that, if they exist in your
plugin, will be called by the core.

This is an empty Foswiki plugin. It is a fully defined plugin, but is
disabled by default in a Foswiki installation. Use it as a template
for your own plugins.

To interact with Foswiki use ONLY the official APIs
documented in %SYSTEMWEB%.DevelopingPlugins. <strong>Do not reference any
packages, functions or variables elsewhere in Foswiki</strong>, as these are
subject to change without prior warning, and your plugin may suddenly stop
working.

Error messages can be output using the =Foswiki::Func= =writeWarning= and
=writeDebug= functions. These logs can be found in the Foswiki/working/logs
directory.  You can also =print STDERR=; the output will appear in the
webserver error log.  The ENVironment setting =$ENV{FOSWIKI_ASSERTS}= setting makes
Foswiki less tolerant of errors, and it is recommended to set it during
development.  It can be set by editing =bin/LocalLib.cfg=, (If missing, see =bin/LocalLib.cfg.txt=)
Most handlers can also throw exceptions (e.g.
[[%SCRIPTURL{view}%/%SYSTEMWEB%/PerlDoc?module=Foswiki::OopsException][Foswiki::OopsException]])

For increased performance, all handler functions except =initPlugin= are
commented out below. *To enable a handler* remove the leading =#= from
each line of the function. For efficiency and clarity, you should
only uncomment handlers you actually use.

__NOTE:__ When developing a plugin it is important to remember that
Foswiki is tolerant of plugins that do not compile. In this case,
the failure will be silent but the plugin will not be available.
See %SYSTEMWEB%.InstalledPlugins for error messages.

__NOTE:__ Foswiki:Development.StepByStepRenderingOrder helps you decide which
rendering handler to use. When writing handlers, keep in mind that these may
be invoked on included topics. For example, if a plugin generates links to the
current topic, these need to be generated before the =afterCommonTagsHandler=
is run. After that point in the rendering loop we have lost the information
that the text had been included from another topic.

__NOTE:__ Not all handlers (and not all parameters passed to handlers) are
available with all versions of Foswiki. Where a handler has been added
the POD comment will indicate this with a "Since" line
e.g. *Since:* Foswiki::Plugins::VERSION 1.1

Deprecated handlers are still available, and can continue to be used to
maintain compatibility with earlier releases, but will be removed at some
point in the future. If you do implement deprecated handlers, then you can
do no harm by simply keeping them in your code, but you are recommended to
implement the alternative as soon as possible.

See http://foswiki.org/Download/ReleaseDates for a breakdown of release
versions.

# $VERSION is referred to by Foswiki, and is the only global variable that
# *must* exist in this package. For best compatibility, the simple quoted decimal
# version '1.00' is preferred over the triplet form 'v1.0.0'.

# For triplet format, The v prefix is required, along with "use version".

# It is a manually maintained string used to identify functionality steps.
# You can use any of the following formats:

#           usually refer to major.minor.patch release or similar. You can
#           use as many numbers as you like e.g. '1' or '1.2.3.4.5'.
# isodate - a date in ISO8601 format e.g. 2009-08-07
# date    - a date in 1 Jun 2009 format. Three letter English month names only.
# Note: it's important that this string is exactly the same in the extension
# topic - if you use %$RELEASE% with BuildContrib this is done automatically.

# is not recommended. Instead, leave $NO_PREFS_IN_TOPIC at 1 and use
# =$Foswiki::cfg= entries, or if you want the users
# to be able to change settings, then use standard Foswiki preferences that
# can be defined in your %USERSWEB%.%LOCALSITEPREFS% and overridden at the web

Called to initialise the plugin. If everything is OK, should return
a non-zero value. On non-fatal failure, should write a message
using =Foswiki::Func::writeWarning= and return 0. In this case
%<nop>FAILEDPLUGINS% will indicate which plugins failed.

In the case of a catastrophic failure that will prevent the whole
installation from working safely, this handler may use 'die', which
will be trapped and reported in the browser.

__Note:__ Please align macro names with the Plugin name, e.g. if
your Plugin is called !FooBarPlugin, name macros FOOBAR and/or
FOOBARSOMETHING. This avoids namespace issues.

---+++ preload($class, $session)

This method is called as early as possible in the processing of a request;
before =initPlugin= is called, before any preferences are loaded, before
even the store is loaded, and before the user has been identified.

It is intended for use when there is sufficient information available
from the request object and the environment to make a decision
on something. For example, it could be used to check the source IP
address of a request, and decide whether to service it or not.

=preload= can use the methods of =Foswiki::Func= to access the request,
but must not access the store, or any user or preference information.
Caveat emptor! You have been warned!

The best way to terminate the request from =preload= is to throw an
exception. You can do this using a =die=, which will result in a
=text/plain= response being sent to the client. More sophisticated
implementations can use =Foswiki::OopsException= to craft a response.

*Since:* Foswiki 2.0

=cut

# sub preload {
#     die( "Terminate this session" );

=begin TML

---++ earlyInitPlugin()

This method is called after =preload= but before =initPlugin=. It is
called after the Foswiki infrastructure has been set up. If it returns
a non-null error string, the plugin will be disabled. You can also
terminate the request from this method by throwing one of the
exceptions handled by =Foswiki::UI= (for example, =Foswiki::OopsException=).

   * =$loginName= - login name recovered from $ENV{REMOTE_USER}
   * =$url= - request url

Allows a plugin to set the username. Normally Foswiki gets the username
from the login manager. This handler gives you a chance to override the
login manager.

Return the *login* name.

This handler is called very early, immediately after =earlyInitPlugin=.

---++ finishPlugin()

Called when Foswiki is shutting down, this handler can be used by the plugin
to release resources - for example, shut down open database connections,
release allocated memory etc.

Note that it's important to break any cycles in memory allocated by plugins,
or that memory will be lost when Foswiki is run in a persistent context
e.g. mod_perl.

---++ validateRegistrationHandler($data)
   * =$data= - a hashref containing all the formfields POSTed to the registration script

Called when a new user registers with this Foswiki. The handler is called after the
user data has been validated by the core, but *before* the user is created and *before*
any validation mail is sent out. The handler will be called on all plugins that implement
it.

Note that the handler may modify fields in the $data record, but must be aware that
these fields have already been checked and validated before the handler is called,
so modifying them is dangerous, and strictly at the plugin author's own risk.

If the handler needs to abort the registration for any reason it can do so by raising
an exception ( e.g. using =die= )

*Since:* Foswiki::Plugins::VERSION = '2.0'

   * =$wikiName= - users wiki name
   * =$loginName= - users login name
   * =$data= - a hashref containing all the formfields POSTed to the registration script

Called when a new user registers with this Foswiki.

Note that the handler is *not* called when the user submits the registration
form if {Register}{NeedVerification} is enabled. In this case it is called when
the user submits the activation code. The handler is only called once, on the first
plugin seen that implements it.

*WARNING* The handler is called *after* the user has been created, and is really
designed for nothing more sophisticated than adding a cookie at registration
time. For most purposes it is useless, and you really wanted to implement the
validateRegistrationHandler instead.

*Deprecated in:* Foswiki::Plugins::VERSION 2.3

   * =$included= - Boolean flag indicating whether the handler is
     invoked on an included topic
   * =$meta= - meta-data object for the topic MAY BE =undef=
This handler is called by the code that expands %<nop>MACROS% syntax in
the topic body and in form fields. It may be called many times while
a topic is being rendered.

Only plugins that have to parse the entire topic content should implement
this function. For expanding macros with trivial syntax it is *far* more
efficient to use =Foswiki::Func::registerTagHandler= (see =initPlugin=).

Internal Foswiki macros, (and any macros declared using
=Foswiki::Func::registerTagHandler=) are expanded _before_, and then again
_after_, this function is called to ensure all %<nop>MACROS% are expanded.

*NOTE:* when this handler is called, &lt;verbatim> blocks have been
removed from the text (though all other blocks such as &lt;pre> and
&lt;noautolink> are still present).

*NOTE:* meta-data is _not_ embedded in the text passed to this
handler. Use the =$meta= object.

---++ preRenderingHandler( $text, \%map )
   * =$text= - text, with the head, verbatim and pre blocks replaced
     with placeholders
   * =\%removed= - reference to a hash that maps the placeholders to
     the removed blocks.

Handler called immediately before Foswiki syntax structures (such as lists) are
processed, but after all variables have been expanded. Use this handler to
process special syntax only recognised by your plugin.

Placeholders are text strings constructed using the tag name and a
sequence number e.g. 'pre1', "verbatim6", "head1" etc. Placeholders are
inserted into the text inside &lt;!--!marker!--&gt; characters so the
text will contain &lt;!--!pre1!--&gt; for placeholder pre1.

Each removed block is represented by the block text and the parameters
passed to the tag (usually empty) e.g. for
<verbatim>
<pre class='slobadob'>
XYZ
</pre>
</verbatim>
the map will contain:
<pre>
$removed->{'pre1'}{text}:   XYZ
$removed->{'pre1'}{params}: class="slobadob"
</pre>
Iterating over blocks for a single tag is easy. For example, to prepend a
line number to every line of every pre block you might use this code:
<verbatim>
foreach my $placeholder ( keys %$map ) {
    if( $placeholder =~ m/^pre/i ) {
        my $n = 1;
        $map->{$placeholder}{text} =~ s/^/$n++/gem;
    }
}

     attachment. The stream can be assumed to be seekable, and the file
     pointer will be positioned at the start. It is *not* necessary to
     reset the file pointer to the start of the stream after you are
     done, nor is it necessary to close the stream.

The handler may wish to replace the original data served by the stream
with new data. In this case, the handler can set the ={stream}= to a
new stream.

For example:
<verbatim>
sub beforeUploadHandler {
    my ( $attrs, $meta ) = @_;
    my $fh = $attrs->{stream};
    local $/;
    # read the whole stream
    my $text = <$fh>;
    # Modify the content
    $text =~ s/investment bank/den of thieves/gi;
    $fh = new File::Temp();
    print $fh $text;
    $attrs->{stream} = $fh;

}
</verbatim>

---++ afterUploadHandler(\%attrHash, $meta )
   * =\%attrHash= - reference to hash of attachment attribute values
   * =$meta= - a Foswiki::Meta  object where the upload has happened

This handler is called just after the after the attachment
meta-data in the topic has been saved. The attributes hash
will include at least the following attributes, all of which are read-only:
   * =attachment= => the attachment name
   * =comment= - the comment
   * =user= - the user id

---++ mergeHandler( $diff, $old, $new, \%info ) -> $text
Try to resolve a difference encountered during merge. The =differences= 
array is an array of hash references, where each hash contains the 
following fields:
   * =$diff= => one of the characters '+', '-', 'c' or ' '.
      * '+' - =new= contains text inserted in the new version
      * '-' - =old= contains text deleted from the old version
      * 'c' - =old= contains text from the old version, and =new= text
        from the version being saved
      * ' ' - =new= contains text common to both versions, or the change
        only involved whitespace
   * =$old= => text from version currently saved
   * =$new= => text from version being saved
   * =\%info= is a reference to the form field description { name, title,
     type, size, value, tooltip, attributes, referenced }. It must _not_
     be wrtten to. This parameter will be undef when merging the body
     text of the topic.

Plugins should try to resolve differences and return the merged text. 
For example, a radio button field where we have 
={ diff=>'c', old=>'Leafy', new=>'Barky' }= might be resolved as 
='Treelike'=. If the plugin cannot resolve a difference it should return 
undef.

The merge handler will be called several times during a save; once for 
each difference that needs resolution.

If any merges are left unresolved after all plugins have been given a 
chance to intercede, the following algorithm is used to decide how to 
merge the data:
   1 =new= is taken for all =radio=, =checkbox= and =select= fields to 
     resolve 'c' conflicts
   1 '+' and '-' text is always included in the the body text and text
     fields
   1 =&lt;del>conflict&lt;/del> &lt;ins>markers&lt;/ins>= are used to 
     mark 'c' merges in text fields

The merge handler is called whenever a topic is saved, and a merge is 
required to resolve concurrent edits on a topic.

---++ modifyHeaderHandler( \%headers, $query )
   * =\%headers= - reference to a hash of existing header values
   * =$query= - reference to CGI query object
Lets the plugin modify the HTTP headers that will be emitted when a
page is written to the browser. \%headers= will contain the headers
proposed by the core, plus any modifications made by other plugins that also
implement this method that come earlier in the plugins list.
<verbatim>
$headers->{expires} = '+1h';
</verbatim>

Note that this is the HTTP header which is _not_ the same as the HTML
&lt;HEAD&gt; tag. The contents of the &lt;HEAD&gt; tag may be manipulated
using the =Foswiki::Func::addToHEAD= method.

---++ renderFormFieldForEditHandler($name, $type, $size, $value, $attributes, $possibleValues) -> $html

This handler is called before built-in types are considered. It generates 
the HTML text rendering this form field, or false, if the rendering 
should be done by the built-in type handlers.
   * =$name= - name of form field
   * =$type= - type of form field (checkbox, radio etc)
   * =$size= - size of form field
   * =$value= - value held in the form field
   * =$attributes= - attributes of form field 
   * =$possibleValues= - the values defined as options for form field, if
     any. May be a scalar (one legal value) or a ref to an array
     (several legal values)

Return HTML text that renders this field. If false, form rendering
continues by considering the built-in types.

*Since:* Foswiki::Plugins::VERSION 2.0

Note that you can also extend the range of available
types by providing a subclass of =Foswiki::Form::FieldDefinition= to implement
the new type (see =Foswiki::Extensions.JSCalendarContrib= and
=Foswiki::Extensions.RatingContrib= for examples). This is the preferred way to
extend the form field types.

=begin TML

---++ renderWikiWordHandler($linkText, $hasExplicitLinkLabel, $web, $topic) -> $linkText
   * =$linkText= - the text for the link i.e. for =[<nop>[Link][blah blah]]=
     it's =blah blah=, for =BlahBlah= it's =BlahBlah=, and for [[Blah Blah]] it's =Blah Blah=.
   * =$hasExplicitLinkLabel= - true if the link is of the form =[<nop>[Link][blah blah]]= (false if it's ==<nop>[Blah]] or =BlahBlah=)
   * =$web=, =$topic= - specify the link being rendered

Called during rendering, this handler allows the plugin a chance to change
the rendering of labels used for links.

Return the new link text.

NOTE: this handler is to allow a plugin to change the link text for a possible link - it may never be used.
for example, Set ALLOWTOPICVIEW = is a possible ACRONYM link that will not be displayed unless the topic exists
similarly, this handler is called before the Plurals code has a chance to remove the 's' from WikiWords

---++ completePageHandler($html, $httpHeaders)

This handler is called on the ingredients of every page that is
output by the standard CGI scripts. It is designed primarily for use by
cache and security plugins.
   * =$html= - the body of the page (normally &lt;html>..$lt;/html>)
   * =$httpHeaders= - the HTTP headers. Note that the headers do not contain
     a =Content-length=. That will be computed and added immediately before
     the page is actually written. This is a string, which must end in \n\n.

*Since:* Foswiki::Plugins::VERSION 2.0

=cut

#sub completePageHandler {
#    my( $html, $httpHeaders ) = @_;
#    # modify $_[0] or $_[1] if you must change the HTML or headers
#    # You can work on $html and $httpHeaders in place by using the
#    # special perl variables $_[0] and $_[1]. These allow you to operate
#    # on parameters as if they were passed by reference; for example:
#    # $_[0] =~ s/SpecialString/my alternative/ge;
#}

=begin TML

---++ restExample($session, $subject, $verb, $response) -> $text
   * =$session= - The Foswiki object associated with this request.
   * =$subject= - The invoked subject (may be ignored)
   * =$verb= - The invoked verb (may be ignored)
   * =$response= reference to the Foswiki::Response object that is used to compose a reply to the request

If the =redirectto= parameter is not present on the request, then the return
value from the handler is used to determine the endpoint for the
request. It can be:
   * =undef= - causes the core to assume the handler handled the complete
     request i.e. the core will not generate any response to the request.
   * =text= - any other non-undef value will be written out as the content
     of an HTTP 200 response. Only the standard headers in the response are
     written.

Additional parameters can be recovered via the query object in the $session, for example:

my $query = $session->{request};
my $web = $query->{param}->{web}[0];

If your rest handler adds or replaces equivalent functionality to a standard script
provided with Foswiki, it should set the appropriate context in its switchboard entry.
In addition to the obvous contexts:  =view=, =diff=,  etc. the =static= context is used
to indicate that the resulting output will be read offline, such as in a PDF,  and 
dynamic links (edit, sorting, etc) should not be rendered.

A comprehensive list of core context identifiers used by Foswiki is found in
%SYSTEMWEB%.IfStatements#Context_identifiers. Please be careful not to
overwrite any of these identifiers!

For more information, check %SYSTEMWEB%.CommandAndCGIScripts#rest

For information about handling error returns from REST handlers, see
Foswiki:Support.Faq1

#   my ( $session, $subject, $verb, $response ) = @_;
#
#   # Use return to have foswiki manage the output
#   return "This is an example of a REST invocation\n\n";
#
#   # To completely control the output from the handler:
#   $response->headers()   - output headers, which must be utf-8 encoded
#   $response->body()      - output binary data that should not be encoded.
#   $response->print()     - output unicode text.
#   # Note that print() and body() may not be combined.  Use one or the other.

---++ Deprecated handlers

---+++ redirectCgiQueryHandler($query, $url )
   * =$query= - the CGI query
   * =$url= - the URL to redirect to

This handler can be used to replace Foswiki's internal redirect function.

If this handler is defined in more than one plugin, only the handler
in the earliest plugin in the INSTALLEDPLUGINS list will be called. All
the others will be ignored.

*Deprecated in:* Foswiki::Plugins::VERSION 2.1

This handler was deprecated because it cannot be guaranteed to work, and
caused a significant impediment to code improvements in the core.

---+++ beforeAttachmentSaveHandler(\%attrHash, $topic, $web )

   * =\%attrHash= - reference to hash of attachment attribute values
   * =$topic= - the name of the topic in the current CGI query
   * =$web= - the name of the web in the current CGI query
This handler is called once when an attachment is uploaded. When this
handler is called, the attachment has *not* been recorded in the database.

The attributes hash will include at least the following attributes:
   * =attachment= => the attachment name
   * =comment= - the comment
   * =user= - the user id
   * =tmpFilename= - name of a temporary file containing the attachment data

*Deprecated in:* Foswiki::Plugins::VERSION 2.1

The efficiency of this handler (and therefore it's impact on performance)
is very bad. Please use =beforeUploadHandler()= instead.

=begin TML

---+++ afterAttachmentSaveHandler(\%attrHash, $topic, $web )

   * =\%attrHash= - reference to hash of attachment attribute values
   * =$topic= - the name of the topic in the current CGI query
   * =$web= - the name of the web in the current CGI query
   * =$error= - any error string generated during the save process (always
     undef in 2.1)

This handler is called just after the save action. The attributes hash
will include at least the following attributes:
   * =attachment= => the attachment name
   * =comment= - the comment
   * =user= - the user id

*Deprecated in:* Foswiki::Plugins::VERSION 2.1

This handler has a number of problems including security and performance
issues. Please use =afterUploadHandler()= instead.
