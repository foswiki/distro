# Foswiki - The Free and Open Source Wiki, https://foswiki.org/
# See bottom of file for license and copyright information.
#
# This file contains a specification of the parts of Foswiki that can be
# configured using =configure=. It is combined with =Config.spec= files
# shipped with extensions to generate the interface seen when you run
# =configure=.
#
# When you run configure from your browser, it will work out required
# settings and write a new LocalSite.cfg. It should never be necessary to
# modify this file directly.
#
# If for some strange reason you want to brew your own LocalSite.cfg by
# copying this file (NOT recommended),  then you must un-comment and complete
# settings that are commented out, and remove everything from __END__ onwards.
#
# See 'setlib.cfg' in the 'bin' directory for how to configure a non-standard
# include path for Perl modules.

#############################################################################
#
# NOTE FOR DEVELOPERS:
# The comments in this file are formatted so that the =configure= script
# can extract documentation from here. See
# https://foswiki.org/System/DevelopingPlugins#Integrating_with_configure
# for details of the syntax used.
#
# You can use $Foswiki::cfg variables in other settings,
# but you must be sure they are only evaluated under program control and
# NOT when this file is loaded. For example:
## $Foswiki::cfg{Blah} = "$Foswiki::cfg{DataDir}/blah.dat"; # BAD
## $Foswiki::cfg{Blah} = '$Foswiki::cfg{DataDir}/blah.dat'; # GOOD
#
# Note that the general path settings are deliberately commented out.
# This is because they *must* be defined in LocalSite.cfg, and *not* here.

# If Javascript is known not to be available in browsers that use the site,
# or cookies are disabled, but you still want validation of submissions,

# forms more than once. If this warning screen is a problem for your users, you
# can disable this setting which enables reuse of validation keys.

#    * =htdigest-md5= - Strongest only when combined with the

#    * =apache-md5= - Enable an Apache-specific algorithm using an iterated

#      is the encoding generated by the =htpasswd -s= command
#      (=userid:{SHA}hash=).
#    * =crypt-md5= -  Enable use of standard libc (/etc/shadow)
#      crypt-md5 password (like =user:$1$salt$hash:email=).  Unlike
#      =crypt= encoding, it does not suffer from password truncation.
#      Passwords are salted, and the salt is stored in the encrypted

#    * =crypt= - encoding uses the first 8 characters of the password.
#      This is the default generated by the Apache =htpasswd= command
#      (=user:hash:email=).  *Not Recommended.*
#    * =plain= - stores passwords as plain text (no encryption). Useful

# If you need to create entries in =.htpasswd= before Foswiki is operational,

# Extensions Repositories Search List.
# Foswiki extension repositories are just Foswiki webs that are organised in the
# same way as the Extensions web on Foswiki.org. The 'Search for extensions'
# button searches these repositories for installable extensions. To set up an
# extensions repository:
#    1 Create a Foswiki web to contain the repository
#    2 Copy the =FastReport= page from [[https://foswiki.org/Extensions/FastReport?raw=on][Foswiki:Extensions.FastReport]] to your new web
#    3 Set the =WEBFORMS= preference in WebPreferences to =PackageForm=
# The page for each extension must have the =PackageForm= (copy from
# Foswiki.org), and should have the packaged extension attached as a
# =zip= and/or =tgz= file.
#
# The search list is a semicolon-separated list of repository
# specifications, each in the format: =name=(listurl,puburl,username,password)=
# where:
#    * =name= is the symbolic name of the repository, for example Foswiki.org
#    * =listurl= is the root of a view URL
#    * =puburl= is the root of a download URL
#    * =username= is the username if TemplateAuth is required on the
#      repository (optional)
#    * =password= is the password if TemplateAuth is required on the
#      repository (optional)
# Note: if your Repository uses ApacheAuth, embed the username and password
# into the listurl as =?username=x;password=y=
#
# For example,=
