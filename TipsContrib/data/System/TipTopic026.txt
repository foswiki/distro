---+ !SlideShowPlugin for presentations

Use SlideShowPlugin to convert a topic with headings and bullets into a slideshow presentation.

This plugin is useful when content is already available in Foswiki - it allows easy creation of web-based presentations which may contain links to related content and live data from Foswiki applications. SlideShowPlugin does not try to compete with the bells and whistles of purpose-built presentation software, however some extra features can be enabled by plugins such as [[Foswiki:Extensions.ChartPlugin][ChartPlugin]], [[Foswiki:Extensions.GaugePlugin][GaugePlugin]], [[SpreadSheetPlugin]], [[Foswiki:Extensions.JHotDrawPlugin][JHotDrawPlugin]] etc.
