---+ !CompareRevisionsAddOn Plugin

This is an helper plugin for the CompareRevisionsAddOn on Foswiki

It has two purposes:
   1 It sets the =CompareRevisionAddonPluginEnabled= flag, which can be used by templates (e.g. used by the HistoryPlugin)
   1 It provides an easy way to replace links to the original =rdiff= script by links to the new =compare= script.

---++ Syntax Rules
   
=%<nop>RDIFF2COMPARE{"text"}%= - Replaces links to the =rdiff= script with links to the =compare= script

---++ Plugin Settings

(none)

---++ Plugin Installation Instructions 

This plugin is installed together with the CompareRevisionsAddOn, see the instructions there.
It should be enabled (if necessary) with the configure script.

Test: <nop>CompareRevisionsAddOnPlugin is %IF{"context CompareRevisionsAddOnPluginEnabled" then="" else="*not* "}%installed and enabled.
