#VarADDTOZONE
---+++ ADDTOZONE

<verbatim class="tml">
%ADDTOZONE{
  "zone"
  ...
}%
</verbatim>

_Zones_ are specific places in the output HTML that are marked with occurances of the [[VarRENDERZONE][RENDERZONE]] macro. Zones are used to collect various content together, such as Javascript and CSS markup that must be included in the output HTML in a specific order, and in a specific place.

You may create as many zones in addition to the standard [[#HeadAndBody][ =head= and =body= ]] zones as you like. Interesting use cases in wiki applications:
   * Create a =sidebar= zone to add widgets,
   * Create a =toolbar= zone to add buttons icons

[[%TOPIC%][ADDTOZONE]] adds content identified with the =id= parameter to =zone=, which will later be expanded with [[VarRENDERZONE][RENDERZONE]]. =id= identifiers are unique within the zone that they are added to. An [[%TOPIC%][ADDTOZONE]] call may ensure that its content appears _after_ the text of some other [[%TOPIC%][ADDTOZONE]] calls by specifying their =ids= in the =requires= parameter. =requires= may only list =ids= within the =zone= being added to, except for the special case of =head= and =body= zones when ={OptimizePageLayout}= is not set (the default - [[#HeadAndBody][read more]]).

*Parameters:*
   * ="zone"= optional, comma-separated list of the names of zones that the content should be added to. Defaults to =head=.
   * =id= optional, =identifier= for the text being added with the =ADDTOZONE= call, to be used in the =requires= parameter of other =ADDTOZONE= calls.
      * %ICON{"info"}% Multiple =ADDTOZONE= calls with the same =id= parameter will simply overwrite the earlier =ADDTOZONE= call.
   * =requires="..."= optional, comma separated string of =ids= of text within this =zone= that should be expanded before this call.
      * %ICON{"info"}% Foswiki only resolves ordering dependencies within a zone.
   * =text="..."= optional, text to be added to the named zone, mutually exclusive with =topic=.
   * =topic="..."= optional, full qualified =web.topic= name that contains the text to be added, mutually exclusive with =text=.
   * =section="..."= optional, section of the =topic= to be added,
     defaults to the default section between [[VarSTARTINCLUDE][STARTINCLUDE]] and [[VarSTOPINCLUDE][STOPINCLUDE]].<br/>
      * %ICON{"info"}% Using =topic= and =section= is actually a short form of 
      <verbatim class="tml">
%ADDTOZONE{
   "myzone"
   text="$percentINCLUDE{\"topic\" section=\"section\" warn=\"off\"}$percent"
}%</verbatim>

#HeadAndBody
---+++ How to use the =head= and =body= zones

Notionally the =head= and =body= zones correspond to the end of the HTML =&lt;HEAD&gt;= tag and the end of the =&lt;BODY&gt;= tag respectively. Normally you should add CSS (and other HTML =&lt;HEAD&gt;= content, such as =&lt;META&gt;=) to the =head= zone, and Javascript to the =body= zone. There is a setting in =configure=, ={OptimizePageLayout}=, that controls what happens next.

First, dependencies between the individual =ADDTOZONE= statements are resolved *within each zone*. Then, if ={OptimizePageLayout}= is enabled, the =head= content is added to the =&lt;HEAD&gt;,= and the =body= content is added to the =&lt;BODY&gt;=. However, if ={OptimizePageLayout}= is disabled (the default), both the =head= and =body= zones will be added to the HTML =&lt;HEAD&gt;=.

For this reason, consideration needs to be given to the way =head= and =body= zones are behaving with your Foswiki configuration, dictated by the ={OptimizePageLayout}= setting

---++++ Working with ={OptimizePageLayout}= disabled (default)
   * Be aware that in this mode, =body= and =head= are separate zones
     when adding to them, but merged as one when you call
     [[VarRENDERZONE][RENDERZONE]]. This allows an ADDTOZONE to the
     =head= to successfully require an =id= that has been added to the
     =body=.
      * %ICON{"info"}% =%<nop>RENDERZONE{"head"}%= will expand *both*
         =head= and =body= zone content. =%<nop>RENDERZONE{"body"}%= will
         be empty.
   * Only add HTML to the body zone _that is also legal in the =&lt;HEAD&gt;=._

---++++ Working with ={OptimizePageLayout}= enabled
   * Ensure that no =head= content (and no inline Javascript) depends on =body= content, or vice-versa. Any such dependency will be _ignored_, however, the HTML comment decoration which normally appears after each id's text in the rendered HTML will contain a small informative text to aid debugging<br/> *Example* <br/>
   <verbatim class="tml">%ADDTOZONE{
   "head"
   text="
   <script type='text/javascript'>
      alert('test');
   </script>"
   requires="some-id-that-exists-in-body"
   id="MY::TEST"
}%</verbatim><br/> *Result*
   <verbatim class="html">
<script type='text/javascript'>
   alert('test');
</script>
<!-- MY::TEST required id(s) that were missing from head zone: some-id-that-exists-in-body --></verbatim>
   By contrast, as explained earlier - when ={OptimizePageLayout}= is disabled (default) - Foswiki is able resolve such dependencies successfully.

#ExampleAddingJS
---+++ Example: Adding Javascript to a page
   * Make sure that all inline Javascript code in the topic (if it is allowed)
     is added to the page using =%<nop>ADDTOZONE{"body"...requires="library-id"}%=
     with the appropriate library-id to guarantee a correct load order. For example, jQuery code should be added as follows:
     %JQREQUIRE{"chili"}%<verbatim class="js">
%JQREQUIRE{"shake"}%%ADDTOZONE{
   "body"
   id="MyApp::ShakePart"
   text="
   <script type='text/javascript'>
      jQuery('#something').shake(3, 10, 180);
   </script>"
   requires="JQUERYPLUGIN::SHAKE"
}%</verbatim> where "MyApp::ShakePart" is a unique =id= to identify the text added to body; and =JQUERYPLUGIN::SHAKE= signifies that the content added with that identifier should appear beforehand.

#ExampleAddingCSS
---+++ Example: Adding CSS to a page
<verbatim class="tml">
%ADDTOZONE{"head"
   id="MyCSS"
   text="
      <style type='text/css' media='all'>
         @import url('%PUBURLPATH%/%SYSTEMWEB%/MyCSS/foo.css');
      </style>"
}%
</verbatim>
