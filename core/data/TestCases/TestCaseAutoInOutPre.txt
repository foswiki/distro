Description: check the behaviour of the inside and outside PRE handlers
This test is designed to be automatic; it cannot be performed manually.

[[%SCRIPTURL{"view"}%/%WEB%/%TOPIC%?test=compare&amp;debugenableplugins=TestFixturePlugin&skin=pattern][run this test]]

The TestFixturePlugin has all the handlers defined. For each handler call, it will replace the text "%handlerNameN%" (where handlerName is the name of the handler and N is a digit) with a unique identifier. The identifier is composed as:

NXXXM_lineL

where N is the digit from %handleNameN%, XXX is OPH for outsidePreHandler etc, and L is the number of the line processed in this call to the handler.
