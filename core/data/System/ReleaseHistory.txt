---++ Foswiki Release 1.0.0 - 09 Jan 2009

Foswiki is the old TWiki project under a new name. Restrictions on the use of the TWiki brand resulted in many of its developers continuing the project under the new Foswiki name. Foswiki is backwards compatible with all content from older TWiki installations. Foswiki 1.0.0 ships with a !TWikiCompatibilityPlugin installed and activated by default, thus enabling most extensions made for TWiki to work under Foswiki.

---+++!! New features and enhancements

   * Foswiki 1.0.0 is built on a new platform called [[Foswiki:Development.FoswikiStandAlone][Foswiki Stand Alone]] which adds support for [[Foswiki:Extensions.FastCGIEngineContrib][FastCGI]] and enables more optimized functionality in mod_perl and other similar runtime environments. Foswiki Stand Alone also enables future features such as running Foswiki by itself without a separate web server (for example, from a stand alone memory key). You can ensure your applications and plugins will work properly on the new platform (and thus with any future capabilities dependent on the new architecture) by testing them out now with Foswiki 1.0.0.
   * A !TWikiCompatibilityPlugin has been created that enables most extensions made for TWiki to work under Foswiki, and to support seamless migrations from TWiki to Foswiki.
   * The PatternSkin has been given a facelift: The PatternSkin topic offers a choice of multiple themes, the sidebar can be placed either on the left or right, a frame can be added around the main content area, and a TWiki theme is available to make it easier for those upgrading from TWiki (dimensions such as the top bar size match the dimensions in the TWiki PatternSkin).
   * The "Advanced Search" page now supports a query-based search.
   * A new section type, "expandvariables", adds better control over macro expansion in topic templates. You can now create template topics with sections where all macros contained within the sections are expanded.
   * A "Copy topic" feature is now present in the "More topic actions" tools.
   * IF conditions has been expanded with an "isempty" test condition.
   * =viewfile= script can be used as a webserver _ErrorDocument_ enabling both more secure attachments and user focused error dialogs.

---+++!! Security Updates

Foswiki is much more secure than TWiki 4.2.4.

   * Foswiki 1.0.0 has secured by default the powerful but also vulnerable URLPARAM macro against cross site scripting (XSS) attacks. URLPARAM now by default encodes a short list of unsafe characters ='"&lt;&gt;%= which eliminates most XSS possibilities encountered with URLPARAM. This protects all topics using the URLPARAM macro without requiring any changes to them.
   * Functions QUERYPARAMS, ORIGURL (skin macro) are secured against XSS attacks. QUERYPARAMS, like URLPARAM, is now encoded with the new, safe encoding.
   * The print preview link is no longer vulnerable to XSS attacks.
   * Additional security fixes have been made, based on security audits performed by the Foswiki team. Sensitive data from the topic text and web client requests are validated for safety.

---+++!! Terminology changes in Foswiki

As part of the first Foswiki product release, various topics and terms were changed to avoid using the TWiki brand name and to more accurately reflect their purpose, including the following:

   * The TWiki web is now called System, as it contains configuration information for the entire Foswiki installation. The !TWikiCompatibilityPlugin provides backwards compatible support for references to the TWiki web, in order to facilitate migrations from TWiki to Foswiki.
   * The %<nop>TWIKIWEB% and %<nop>MAINWEB% variables are now called %<nop>SYSTEMWEB% and %<nop>USERSWEB%
   * Topics in the Foswiki distribution have been renamed to eliminate the TWiki word and to make the titles more readable (for example, Plugins, Skins, and so forth).
   * All templates, CSS and Javascript names have been changed from twikiXxxxx to foswikiXxxxx
   * Key terminology changes:
     | *TWiki term* | *Foswiki term* |
     | TWiki variable | Macro |
     | preference(s) variable | preference setting, or macro when referring to expansion of same |
     | TWiki form | Data form |
     | TWiki Plugin | Plugin |
     | TWiki Template | Skin Template |
     | Topic Template | Template Topic |
     | TWiki Markup Language (TML) | Topic Markup Language (TML) |
     | TWiki Application | Wiki Application |

#FreetownRelease 
---++ TWiki Release 4.2.1 (Freetown) released 22 Jan 2008

#EdinburghRelease
---++ TWiki Release 4.1 (Edinburgh), 16 Jan 2007

*New Features and Enhancements of TWiki Release 4.1*

   * *Easier Installation and Upgrade* 
      * Plugins can now be installed from the configure script.
      * The loading of plugin preferences settings has been moved earlier in the preferences evaluation order so that plugin settings can be redefined in [[%LOCALSITEPREFS%]], !WebPreferences and in topics. To make TWiki upgrades easier, it is recommended to set the plugin settings in <nop>%LOCALSITEPREFS%, and not to customize the settings in the plugin topic. For example, to change the TEMPLATES setting of the CommentPlugin, create a new COMMENTPLUGIN_TEMPLATES setting in <nop>%LOCALSITEPREFS%.
      * Plugin settings can now be defined in configure instead of in the plugin topic (requires that the individual plugin has implemented this). TWiki performs slightly better by not looking for preferences settings in plugin topics.
      * Configure no longer shows many unnecessary errors when run first time.
      * The webmaster email address is now defined in configure instead of !TWikiPreferences.
      * Default file access rights in the distribution package have been changed to be more universally defined and in line with the default access rights for new topics.

   * *Usability Enhancements* 
      * Redesigned result page when typing incomplete topic name into the Jump box, so that it is possible to quickly navigate to a topic, also in a very large TWiki installation. For example, "I know there is a topic about Ajax somewhere in the Eng web. OK, let my type =Eng.ajax= into the Jump box... Here we go, the third link is the !AjaxCookbook I was looking for."
      * Many user documentation improvements.
      * URL parameters maintained in Table of Contents links so you can stay in a temporary skin (e.g. print) and keep URLPARAM values when you click the TOC links
      * Attachment tables now sorted alphabetically.
      * Better printing of tables and verbatim text in PatternSkin.

   * *Application Platform Enhancements* 
      * Auto-incremented topic name on save with AUTOINC&lt;n&gt; in topic name; used by TWiki applications to create topic based database records.
      * The edit and save scripts support a =redirectto= parameter to redirect to a topic or a URL; for security, redirect to URL needs to be enabled with a ={AllowRedirectUrl}= configure flag.
      * CommentPlugin supports the =redirectto= parameter to redirect to a URL or link to TWiki topic after submitting comment.
      * The =topic= URL parameter also respects the ={AllowRedirectUrl}= configure flag so redirects to URLs can be disabled which could be abused for phishing attacks.
      * The view script supports a =section= URL parameter to view just a named section within a topic. Useful for simple AJAX type applications.
      * New plugin handler for content move.
      * Enhancements for Ajax based applications with Foswiki:Extensions/YahooUserInterfaceContrib and Foswiki:Extensions.TWikiAjaxContrib (available at twiki.org).

   * *Search Enhancements* 
      * METASEARCH handles a format parameter like SEARCH.
      * Topic not found / WebTopicViewTemplate search now case insensitive.
      * FormattedSearch header supporting =$nop=, =$quot=, =$percnt=, =$dollar=.
      * Add search by createdate option to SEARCH.
      * New newline option for SEARCH to protect e.g. formfields from being altered during rendering in SEARCH.

   * *Skins and Templates Enhancements* 
      * Support for templates to have text rendering affecting aspect outside of textarea.
      * Pattern skin dependence on TwistyPlugin instead of TwistyContrib (performance improvement.)
      * Don't strip newlines from the front of TMPL:DEFs.

   * *Miscellaneous Feature Enhancements* 
      * Change in WikiWord definition: Numbers are treated as lower case letters, e.g. !Y2K is now a !WikiWord.
      * Configurable template load path. Advanced feature for those that work with customized templates.
      * Added %<nop>VBAR% to !TWikiPreferences for vertical bar symbol.
      * On topic creation, force initial letter of topic name to be upper case.
      * Allow date format in form fields.
      * Enhance REVINFO{} variable with same date qualifiers as GMTIME{}.
      * WebTopicCreator - adding ability to select a template from any topic name ending in ...Template
      * Functionality of Foswiki:Extensions.DateFieldPlugin merged into core

   * *Enhancements of Pre-installed Plugins* 
      * CommentPlugin: Supports removal of comment prompt after a comment is made.
      * EditTablePlugin: Default date format based on JSCalendarContrib instead of plugin topic.
      * InterwikiPlugin: Supports custom link formats.
      * SlideShowPlugin: Preserves URL parameters in slideshow
      * SpreadSheetPlugin: New functions =$LISTRAND()=, =$LISTSHUFFLE()=, =$LISTTRUNCATE()=.
      * TablePlugin: New attribute =cellborder=.
      * TablePlugin: Highlight the sorted column with custom colors; includes also a general cosmetic update of default colors.
      * TablePlugin: Support for initsort on more than one table. A table with the initsort option is initsorted UNLESS it is sorted by clicking on a column header. If you click on a header of another table all other tables goes back to the default sort defined by initsort or not sorted if no initsort, and the new table is sorted based on the user clicking on a table header.

   * *Bugfixes* 
      * More than 200 bugs fixed since 4.0.5
