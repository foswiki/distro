=begin TML

Configuration script for Foswiki. Once you have a basic webserver
configuration that lets you access this script, the rest of the
configuration process is done from here.

This script is the dispatcher for several request types, and the container
for session management functions used by all request types.

Detailed TML documentation is available following the  __END__ marker.

=begin TML

The script works from the top down, by checking features of the
environment before moving on. The sequence is:
   1. Check the version of perl
   2. Check we have the modules to run this script
   3. Check the environment
   4. Check we have the modules to load the rest of configure
... and so on. At any stage, the script reports any errors in the
best way it can given the environment established so far.
When the basic checks are complete, the script moves into the
real configuration steps; setting configuration variables.

This phase of the configure environment follows a Model-View-
Controller pattern.

---++ Controller
This script is the controller; it handles communication with the
browser (and thus the user). Communication is very simple; this script
is re-invoked with different 'action' parameters to determine what it does.

---++ Model
The Model consists of a simple node tree, where each node represents a
structural element in the *presentation* of the configuration (this may
not be consistent with the structure of $Foswiki:cfg, so beware). Each
leaf node has an associated Type (in the Types subdirectory) that has
collected model and view behaviours for the basic types.

Class hierarchy
  * Foswiki::Configure::Item
     * Foswiki::Configure::Value - a leaf value
     * Foswiki::Configure::Section - a running node
        * Foswiki::Configure::Root - a root section
        * Foswiki::Configure::Pluggable - a plug-in subsection
           * Foswiki::Configure::Pluggables::FINDEXTENSIONS - etc
        * Foswiki::Configure::Checkers::Introduction - should be a Pluggable
        * Foswiki::Configure::Checkers::Welcome - should be a Pluggable
        * Foswiki::Configure::Checkers::MSWin32 - should be a Pluggable
The Model is independent of the language used to represent the
configuration. There is one parser/generator provided, FoswikiCfg, but it
would be trivial to add others.

---++ View
The View is a DOM document, generated as HTML by a set of UI classes,
all subclasses of Foswiki::Configure::UI. The UI classes visit the
model in order to generate the HTML.

---+++ UIs
Each class in the model (Root, Section, Value, Item) has a corresponding UI
decorator object, which renders HTML for the model. There are also a
number of bespoke UIs, some of which assist =configure= in the generation
of full screens (Introduction, Welcome, AUTH, UPDATE, EXTEND, EXTENSIONS,
UPDATE) and others which relate to the Pluggables (FINDEXTENSIONS, LANGUAGES,
PLUGINS). The special UI CGISetup is a specialised Section focused on groping
the CGI configuration. Several of the bespoke UIs (CGISetup, Introduction,
Welcome) have corresponding Checkers, which act as placeholders in the
model for these sections.

Class hierarchy
   * Foswiki::Configure::UI
      * Foswiki::Configure::Checker
         * Foswiki::Configure::Checkers::* - see below
      * Foswiki::Configure::UIs::* - components used in building screens
         * Foswiki::Configure::UIs::Item
            * Foswiki::Configure::UIs::Section
               * Foswiki::Configure::UIs::Root
               * Foswiki::Configure::UIs::Introduction
               * Foswiki::Configure::UIs::Welcome
               * Foswiki::Configure::UIs::MSWin32
               * Foswiki::Configure::UIs::* - other UIs for Pluggables and screens
            * Foswiki::Configure::UIs::Value

---+++ Checkers
Checkers give checking and guessing support for configuration values. Checkers
are all subclasses of Foswiki::Configure::Checker, and inhabit a class
hierarchy under it that mirrors the organisation of configuration keys in
Foswiki.spec.  Checkers include read-only checking UI used for checking
environment sanity (BasicSanity)

Note that when configure is run for the first time (before LocalSite.cfg
has been created) then only the first section of Foswiki.spec is loaded,
and thus checkers only for that subset will be created and run. This means
that on some platforms, initial configuration is a two-phase process, as
the initial path checks are performed on the first run, and only on the
second run, when LocalSite.cfg exists, are the other checkers built and
invoked. This needs improving on.

---+++ Types
Types provide some UI support in the form of type-specific prompters.
This is really an abuse of the Model, but it saves creating
decorator classes for all the Model types.

HTML is generated for the model using Visitor pattern. Each node in the tree
is visited in depth-first order.

Class hierarchy
   * Foswiki::Configure::Type - base
      * Foswiki::Configure::Types::NUMBER - numerical type (perl float values)
         * Foswiki::Configure::Types::OCTAL - octal (permissions)
      * Foswiki::Configure::Types::BOOLEAN - boolean type
         * Foswiki::Configure::Types::LANGUAGE
      * Foswiki::Configure::Types::PERL - perl structure
      * Foswiki::Configure::Types::SELECT - select from a list of values
         * Foswiki::Configure::Types::SELECTCLASS - select a class from a path
      * Foswiki::Configure::Types::STRING - string type
         * Foswiki::Configure::Types::REGEX - regular expression
         * Foswiki::Configure::Types::COMMAND - shell command
         * Foswiki::Configure::Types::PASSWORD - hidden password
         * Foswiki::Configure::Types::PATH - file path (/)
         * Foswiki::Configure::Types::URL - absolute url path (/)
         * Foswiki::Configure::Types::URLPATH - relative url path (/)
      * Foswiki::Configure::Types::UNKNOWN - unknown type

TODO:
The type classes are the obvious place to attach client-side javascript
validators, thus releasing the server-side checkers to consider the "deeper"
issues.
