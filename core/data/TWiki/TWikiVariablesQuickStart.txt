---++ TWiki Variables Quickstart

%STARTINCLUDE%

TWiki Variables are names enclosed in percent signs that are that are expanded to some other text when the topic
is displayed. For example, =%<nop>TOPIC%= is expanded to %TOPIC%.
Some variables can take arguments in curly braces - for example, =%<nop>INCLUDE{"OtherTopic" ARG="arg"}%=.

Many TWiki variables are built-in, and others are predefined for your convenience. You can also define your own
TWiki Variables at the entire site, individual web, or individual topic level. For more information,
go to *[[TWikiVariables]]*

TWiki Variables are fully expanded _before_ any of the TWiki text formatting rules are applied.

*Documentation Graphics:* There are many graphics available to use in your topics. Use =%<nop>ICON{"help"}%=, =%<nop>ICON{"tip"}%=, and =%<nop>ICON{"warning"}%= to get: %H%, %T%, and %X%, respectively. TWikiDocGraphics lists them all.

%ICON{"tip"}% To "escape" a variable, prefix it with an exclamation mark. Write: =!%<nop>SOMEVARIABLE%= to get: !%SOMEVARIABLE%.
