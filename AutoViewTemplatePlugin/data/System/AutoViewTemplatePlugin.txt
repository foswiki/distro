---+ <nop>AutoViewTemplatePlugin
%SHORTDESCRIPTION%

---++ Description
This plugin sets the VIEW_TEMPLATE and EDIT_TEMPLATE variables according to a
corresponding form definition. So when you attach a new form to a topic, this
plugin will enable the corresponding view/edit template automatically.  This
comes in very handy for applications where users create new topics
without the help of a topic creator wizard, e.g. creating a new topic for a yet
non-existing <nop>WikiWord. Together with the appropriate application
settings, this plugin will then assure that the data the user enters is handled
appropriately during view and edit.

There are two modes on how the name of the template is derived:
   1 =exist= (default) and
   1 =section=.

---+++ Mode "exist"
A topic that has a =MyForm= <nop>WikiForm attached to it, will be displayed
using the view template =MyView= and editted using the =MyEdit=
if they exist. The template name is derived by stripping off the suffix
=...Form= from the form name and appending =...View=. The Wiki engine will
then use the template name =MyView= to search for the correct template along
the template search path, for example using a topic =MyView=.

---+++ Mode "section"
A topic with a =MyForm= will be displayed/editted using the template name
stored in the named section =viewtemplate/edittemplate= . For example given the
=MyForm= form definition topic contains a section =viewtemplate= whose only
content is =MyOtherView=, then this will be used to view the topic. Likewise,
the content of the =edittemplate= section in =MyForm= will read to find the
edit template.

By default existing values for VIEW_TEMPLATE and EDIT_TEMPLATE have priority.
You can override this behaviour in =configure=.

---++ Plugin Installation Instructions

   * Just download the zip or tgz and unzip it into your wiki directory.
   * Plugin configuration is done via =configure=.
